The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reports national statistics on, among other things, education. We used the UNESCO graduation data (http://data.uis.unesco.org) labeled “Dis- tribution of tertiary graduates” in the years 2012 to 2015 in natural sciences, mathematics, statistics, information and communication technologies, engineering, manufacturing,
and construction (Table S1). The percentage of women among STEM graduates ranged from 12.4% in Macao to 40.7% in Algeria; the median was 25.4%.
