They were transferred to New Zealand administration in 1925. Referenda held in 2006 and 2007 to change the status of the islands from that of a New Zealand territory to one of free association with New Zealand did not meet the needed threshold for approval."

New Zealand's support amounts to 80% of Tokelau's recurrent government budget.
