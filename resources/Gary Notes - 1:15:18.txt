==== Gary Notes - project implicit === 

- positive that D score is not flipped (emailed project implict): 

The D_biep.Male_Career_all variable is the overall IAT D score and is the variable you will want to use for analysis. Your interpretation is correct that positive scores mean a stronger association for Male and Career and negative scores indicate a strong association for Female and Career. 

- replicate caliskan 

- both would have to be flipped to see this pattern

- maybe related to female-male difference (females have bigger implicit vs. explicit)

- though explicit questions funky

Next things to do:
	* dplace scores
	* examine variability in word relationships
