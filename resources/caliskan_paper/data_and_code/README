First, download the GloVe model to the models folder from: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip 
The extracted model is a 5.65GB text file: glove.840B.300dcasedCommoncrawl.txt

Add the jar files in the lib folder to your classpath.

WEAT: WordEmbeddingAssociationTest - Tests the model for different types of biases:

Pick a number for bias type to test:
type 1:  biasType = flowers-insects-attitude
type 2:  biasType = instruments-weapons-attitude
type 3:  biasType = racial-attitude
type 4:  biasType = racial-attitude-market-discrimination
type 5:  biasType = racial-attitude-market-discrimination-small
type 6:  biasType = gender-bias-career-family
type 7:  biasType = gender-bias-math-arts
type 8:  biasType = gender-bias-science-arts
type 9:  biasType = mental-physical-illness-stability
type 10:  biasType = age-attitude
