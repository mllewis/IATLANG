I'm working with the Gender-Career IAT 2005-2016 project implicit dataset, and I had a quick question about one of the variables. In particular I wanted to confirm that I was interpretting the main outcome variable, D_biep.Male_Career_all, in the correct way. My assumption is that a bigger value indicates a bigger association between male and career - Is that correct? 

Apologies if this information is available somewhere, but I poked around and wasn't able to find it.

Many thanks,
Molly
