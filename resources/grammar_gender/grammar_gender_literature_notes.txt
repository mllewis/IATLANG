------------GRAMMAR GENDER LITERATURE NOTES--------------------------

It is possible that language has the greatest influence on thought in abstract domains like grammatical gender – ones not so reliant on sensory experience (Boroditsky, 2000; 2001)


Bassetti, B. A. L. (2014). Is grammatical gender considered arbitrary or semantically motivated? Evidence from young adult monolinguals, second language learners, and early bilinguals. British Journal of Psychology, 105: 273–294. - this is neat but the pragmatics are weird (suggest that gender is meaningful)

Send en, M.G., Sikstr€om, S., & Lindholm, T. (2015). “She” and “he” in news media messages: Pronoun use reflects gender biases in semantic contexts. Sex Roles, 72(1–2), 40–49. - in corpus of news text male pronouns used more positively using LSA with english text- this is neeat

##### PSYCHOLOINGUISTIC EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF GENDER #######
Bigler 1995 - gender based systems of creaing "teams" of kids leads to categorization (don't want to play with other team)

#### SUBJECTIVE/EXPLICIT JUDEMENTS of GENDER ####
Konishi 1993 - masculine gendered words rated as having more masculine properties (e.g. potent) [subjective judgement]

Sera, Berge Castillo 1994/Sera 2002 - kids assign male voices to male gendered words [subjective judgement]

Bowers et al. 1999
Mills (1986)  - kids assign names to toys consistent with gender 


######## IMPLICT JUDGEMENTS OF GENDER: ########
Cubelli 2011 - psycholinguistic evience - words sharing same gender activate eachother, where task is category judgement

Boroditsky & Schmidt, 2000 - harder to learn when theres a mis-match

## Categorization judgements

Boroditsy, Schmidt, Phillips 2003/phillips Borodistky 2003

Kuriniski (2016) - as hungarian speakers (no genders) learn more spanish (gender), categorization judgements change

Kurinski and Sera (2011) - same as Kurinski 2016 with english speakers

Vernich - categorizaiton - nice review of literature

Athanasopoulos, P., & Boutonnet, B. (2016). Learning grammatical gender in a second language changes categorization of inanimate objects: Replications and new evidence from English learners of L2 French. In R. Alonso Alonso (Ed.), Cross-linguistic influence in second language acquisition (pp. 173–192). Bristol: Multilingual Matters.

Vigliocco 2005 - categorization jugdgement, but effect not for all gendered languages


####### GRAMMATICAL GENDER AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF INEQUALITY ####:

Shoam - wage inquality

Santacreu-Vasut, E., Shenkar, O., & Shoham, A. (2014). Linguistic gender marking and its international
business ramifications. Journal of International Business Studies, 45(9), 1170–1178. - gram- matical gender marking has a negative effect on the participation of females on corporate boards of directors and in the management of large teams. 

Santacreu-Vasut, E., Shoham, A., & Gay, V. (2013). Do female/male distinctions in language matter?
Evidence from gender political quotas. Applied Economics Letters, 20(5), 495–498.

van der Velde, L., Tyrowicz, J., & Siwinska, J. (2015). Language and (the estimates of) the gender wage gap. Economics Letters, 136, 165–170.

L. Davis and Reynolds (2016) show that grammatical gender marking has an impact on the educa- tional attainment between genders. 

Gay, V., Hicks, D.L., Santacreu-Vasut, E., & Shoham, A. (2015). Decomposing culture: Can gendered language influence women’s economic engagement? Fox School of Business Research Paper, 15–46. - GII index

Hechavarr 2018 - gendered languages influences early entruprenual involvemnt, controling for lots of stuff; Overall, men participate 2.1 times more than women when their language uses a sex-based system.

Hicks, D.L., Santacreu-Vasut, E., & Shoham, A. (2015). Does mother tongue make for women’s work? Linguistics, household labor, and gender identity. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 110(1), 19–44.

Lieu (2018) - pronouns and gender equality using WALS and world value survey, nice experimental design with bilinguals where ask gender questions in languages that do and do not have grammatial gender

* look at GII with google 
* look at other outcome measurs, maybe?

MISC: 
# Boroditsky, Schmidt, Phillips, 2002 

- why might grammatical gender be taken as meaningful
- children have no reason to assume its not meaningful (Piaget - moon; essentialism)
- needing to refer to an object may make dimension more meaningful

EXP: 
(1) is memory betteer when give names in english that are gendered consistly with grammar?
(2) Teach novel grammatical category where males are part of level A and females B
