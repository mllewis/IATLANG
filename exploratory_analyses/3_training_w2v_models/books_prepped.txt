then she picked more berries and dropped one in the pail kuplunk and the rest she ate then little sal ate all four blueberries out of her pail her mother walked slowly through the bushes picking blueberries as she went and putting them in her pail little sal struggled along behind picking blueberries and eating every single one little sal hurried ahead and dropped a blueberry in her mother’s pail it didn’t sound kuplink because the bottom of the pail was already covered with berries she reached down inside to get her berry back though she really didn’t mean to she pulled out a large handful because there were so many blueberries right up close to the one she had put in her mother stopped picking and said now sal you run along and pick your own berries mother wants to take her berries home and can them for next winter her mother went back to her picking but little sal because her feet were tired of standing and walking sat down in the middle of a large clump of bushes and ate blueberries on the other side of blueberry hill little bear came with his mother to eat blueberries little bear she said eat lots of berries and grow big and fat we must store up food for the long cold winter little bear followed behind his mother as she walked slowly through the bushes eating berries little bear stopped now and then to eat berries then he had to hustle along to catch up because his feet were tired of hustling he picked out a large clump of bushes and sat down right in the middle and ate blueberries over on the other side of the hill little sal ate all of the berries she could reach from where she was sitting then she started out to find her mother she heard a noise from around a rock and thought that is my mother walking along but it was a mother crow and her children and they stopped eating berries and flew away saying caw caw caw then she heard another noise in the bushes and thought that is surely my mother and i will go that way but it was little bear’s mother instead she was tramping along eating berries and thinking about storing up food for the winter little sal tramped right along behind by this time little bear had eaten all the berries he could reach without moving from his clump of bushes then he hustled off to catch up with his mother he hunted and hunted but his mother was nowhere to be seen he heard a noise from over a stump and thought that is my mother walking along but it was a mother partridge and her children they stopped eating berries and hurried away then he heard a noise in the bushes and thought that is surely my mother then he heard a noise in the bushes and thought that is surely my mother i will hustle that way but it was little sal’s mother instead she was walking along picking berries and thinking about canning them for next winter little bear hustled right along behind little bear and little sal’s mother and little sal and little bear’s mother were all mixed up with each other among the blueberries on blueberry hill little bear’s mother heard sal walking along behind and thought it was little bear and she said little bear munch munch eat all you gulp can possibly hold swallow little sal said nothing she picked three berries and dropped them kuplink kuplank kuplunk in her small tin pail little bear’s mother turned around to see what on earth could make a noise like kuplunk grumph she cried choking on a mouthful of berries this is not my child where is little bear she took one good look and backed away she was old enough to be shy of people even a very small person like little sal then she turned around and walked off very fast to hunt for little bear little sal’s mother heard little bear tramping along behind and thought it was little sal she kept right on picking and thinking about canning blueberries for next winter little bear padded up and peeked into her pail of course he only wanted to taste a few of what was inside but there were so many and they were so close together that he tasted a tremendous mouthful by mistake now sal said little sal’s mother without turning around you run along and pick your own berries mother wants to can these for next winter little bear tasted another tremendous mouthful and almost spilled the entire pail of blueberries little sal’s mother turned around and gasped my goodness you are not little sal where oh where is my child little bear just sat munching and munching and swallowing and licking his lips little sal’s mother slowly backed away she was old enough to be shy of bears even very small bears like little bear then she turned and walked away quickly to look for little sal she hadn’t gone very far before she heard a kuplink kuplank kuplunk she knew just what made that kind of a noise little bear’s mother had not hunted very long before she heard a hustling sound that stopped now and then to munch and swallow she knew just what made that kind of a noise little bear and his mother went home down one side of blueberry hill eating blueberries all the way and full of food stored up for next winter and little sal and her mother went down the other side of blueberry hill picking berries all the way and drove

kitchen table it was saturday morning pancake morning mom was squeezing oranges for juice henry and i were betting on how many pancakes we each could eat and grandpa was doing the flipping seconds later something flew through the air headed toward the kitchen ceiling and landed right on henry after we realized that the flying object was only a pancake we all laughed even grandpa breakfast continued quite uneventfully all the other pancakes landed in the pan and all of them were eaten even the one that landed on henry that night touched off by the pancake incident at breakfast grandpa told us the best tall tale bedtime story he’d ever told across an ocean over lots of huge bumpy mountains across three hot deserts and one smaller ocean there lay the tiny town of chewandswallow in most ways it was very much like any other tiny town it had a main street lined with stores houses with trees and gardens around them a schoolhouse about three hundred people and some assorted cats and dogs but there were no food stores in the town of chewandswallow they didn’t need any the sky supplied all the food they could possibly want the only thing that was really different about chewandswallow was its weather it came three times a day at breakfast lunch and dinner everything that everyone ate came from the sky whatever the weather served that was what they ate but it never rained rain it never snowed snow and it never blew just wind it rained things like soup and juice it snowed mashed potatoes and green peas and sometimes the wind blew in storms of hamburgers the people could watch the weather report on television in the morning and they would even hear a prediction for the next day’s food when the townspeople went outside they carried their plates cups glasses forks spoons knives and napkins with them that way they would always be prepared for any kind of weather if there were leftovers and there usually were the people took them home and put them in their refrigerators in case they got hungry between meals the menu varied by the time they woke up in the morning breakfast was coming down after a brief shower of orange juice low clouds of sunny side up eggs moved in followed by pieces of toast butter and jelly sprinkled down for the toast and most of the time it rained milk afterwards for lunch one day frankfurters already in their rolls blew in from the northwest at about five miles an hour there were mustard clouds nearby then the wind shifted to the east and brought in baked beans a drizzle of soda finished off the meal dinner one night consisted of lamb chops becoming heavy at times with occasional ketchup periods of peas and baked potatoes were followed by gradual clearing with a wonderful jell o setting in the west the sanitation department of chewandswallow had a rather unusual job for a sanitation department it had to remove the goods that fell on the houses and sidewalks and lawns the workers cleaned things up after every meal and fed all the dogs and cats then they emptied some of it into the surrounding oceans for the fish and turtles and whales to eat the rest of the food was put back into the earth so that the soil would be richer for the people’s flower gardens life for the townspeople was delicious until the weather took a turn for the worse one day there was nothing but gorgonzola cheese all day long the next day there was only broccoli all overcooked and the next day there were brussel sprouts and peanut butter with mayonnaise another day there was a pea soup fog no one could see where they were going and they could barely find the rest of the meal that got stuck in the fog the food was getting larger and larger and so were the portions the people were getting frightened violent storms blew up frequently awful things were happening one tuesday there was a hurricane of bread and rolls all day long and into the night there were soft rolls and hard rolls some with seeds and some without there was white bread and rye and whole wheat toast most of it was larger than they had ever seen bread and rolls before it was a terrible day everyone had to stay indoors roofs were damaged and the sanitation department was beside itself the mess took the workers four days to clean up and the sea was full of floating rolls to help out the people piled up as much bread as they could in their backyards the birds picked at it a bit but it just stayed there and got staler and staler there was a storm of pancakes one morning and a downpour of maple syrup that nearly flooded the town a huge pancake covered the school no one could get it off because of its weight so they had to close the school lunch one day brought fifteen inch drifts of cream cheese and jelly sandwiches everyone ate themselves sick and the day ended with a stomachache there was an awful salt and pepper wind accompanied by an even worse tornado people were sneezing themselves silly and running to avoid the tomatoes the town was a mess there were seeds and pulp everywhere the sanitation department gave up the job was too big everyone feared for their lives they couldn’t go outside most of the time many houses had been badly damaged by giant meatballs stores were boarded up and there was no more school for the children so a decision was made to abandon the town of chewandswallow it was a matter of survival the people glued together giant pieces of stale bread sandwich style with peanut butter took the absolute necessities with them and set sail on their rafts for a new land after being afloat for a week they finally reached a small coastal town which welcomed them the bread had held up surprisingly well well enough for them to build temporary houses for themselves out of it the children began school again and the adults all tried to find places for themselves in the new land the biggest change they had to make was getting used to buying food at a supermarket the found it odd that food was kept on shelves packaged in boxes cans and bottles meat that had to be cooked was kept in large refrigerators nothing came down from the sky except rain and snow the clouds above their heads were not made of fried eggs no one ever got hit by a hamburger again and nobody dared to go back to chewandswallow to find out what had happened to it they were too afraid henry and i were awake until the very end of grandpa’s story i remember his goodnight kiss the next morning we woke up to see snow falling outside our window we ran downstairs for breakfast and ate it a little faster than usual so we could go sledding with grandpa it’s funny but even as we were sliding down the hill we thought we saw a giant pat of butter at the top and we could almost smell the mashed potatoes the end corduroy is a bear who once lived in the toy department of a big store day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home the store was always filled with shoppers buying all sorts of things but no one ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into corduroy’s bright eyes oh mommy she said look there’s the very bear i’ve always wanted not today dear her mother sighed i’ve spent too much already besides he doesn’t look new he’s lost the button to one of his shoulder straps corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away l didn’t know i’d lost a button he said to himself tonight i’ll go and see if i can find it late that evening when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button suddenly he felt the floor moving under him quite by accident he had stepped onto an escalator and up he went could this be a mountain he wondered i think i’ve always wanted to climb a mountain he wandered around admiring the furniture this must be a bed he said i’ve always wanted to sleep in a bed and up he crawled onto a large thick mattress all at once he saw something small and round why here’s my button he cried and he tried to pick it up but like all the other buttons on the mattress it was tied down tight he yanked and pulled with both paws until pop off came the button and off the mattress corduroy toppled bang into a tall floor lamp over it fell with a crash corduroy didn’t know it but there was someone else awake in the store the night watchman was doing his rounds on the floor above when he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator now who in the world did that he exclaimed somebody must be hiding around here he flashed his light under and over sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking up from under the cover hello he said how did you get upstairs the watchman tucked corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator and set him on the shelf in the toy department with the other animals and dolls corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning and there looking at him with a wide warm smile was the same little girl he’d seen only the day before i’m lisa she said and you’re going to be my very own bear last night i counted what i’ve saved in my piggy bank and my mother said i could bring you home shall i put him in a box for you the saleslady asked oh no thank you lisa answered and she carried corduroy home in her arms she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family’s apartment and straight to her own room corduroy blinked there was a chair and a chest of drawers and alongside a girl size bed stood a little bed just the right size for him the room was small nothing like that enormous palace in the department store this must be home he said i know i’ve always wanted a home lisa sat down with corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls i like you the way you are she said but you’ll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened you must be a friend said corduroy i’ve always wanted a friend me too said lisa and gave him a big hug this is george he lived in africa he was a good little monkey and always very curious one day george saw a man he had on a large yellow straw hat the man saw george too what a nice little monkey he thought i would like to take him home with me he put his hat on the ground and of course george was curious he came down from the tree to look at the large yellow hat the hat had been on the man’s head george thought it would be nice to have it on his own head he picked it up and put it on the hat covered george’s head he couldn’t see the man picked him up quickly and popped him into a bag george was caught the man with the big yellow hat put george into a little boat and a sailor rowed them both across the water to a big ship george was sad but he was still a little curious on the big ship things began to happen the man took off the bag george sat on a little stool and the man said george i am going to take you to a big zoo in a big city you will like it there now run along and play but don’t get into trouble george promised to be good but it is easy for little monkeys to forget on the deck he found some sea gulls he wondered how they could fly he was very curious finally he had to try it looked easy but oh what happened first this and then this where is george the sailors looked and looked at last they saw him struggling in the water and almost all tired out man overboard the sailors cried as they threw him a lifebelt george caught it and held on at last he was safe on board after that george was more careful to be a good monkey until at last the long trip was over george said good bye to the kind sailors and he and the man with the yellow hat walked off the ship on to the shore and on into the city to the man’s house after a good meal and a good pipe george felt very tired he crawled into bed and fell asleep at once the next morning the man telephoned the zoo george watched him he was fascinated then the man went away george was curious he wanted to telephone too one two three four five six seven what fun ding a ling a ling george had telephoned the fire station the firemen rushed to the telephone hello hello they said but there was no answer then they looked for the signal on the big map that showed where the telephone call had come from they didn’t know it was george they thought it was a teal fire hurry hurry hurry the firemen jumped on to the fire engines and on to the hook and ladders ding dong ding dong everyone out of the way hurry hurry hurry the firemen rushed into the house they opened the door no fire only a naughty little monkey oh catch him catch him they cried george tried to run away he almost did but he got caught in the telephone wire and a thin fireman caught one arm and a fat fireman caught the other you fooled the fire department they said we will have to shut you up where you can’t do any more harm they took him away and shut him in a prison george wanted to get out he climbed up to the window to try the bars just then the watchman came in he got on the wooden bed to catch george but he was too big and heavy the bed tipped up the watchman fell over and quick as lightning george ran out through the open door he hurried through the building and out on to the roof and then he was lucky to be a monkey out he walked on to the telephone wires quickly and quietly over the guard’s head george walked away he was free down in the street outside the prison wall stood a balloon man a little girl bought a balloon for her brother george watched he was curious again he felt he must have a bright red balloon he reached over and tried to help himself but instead of one balloon the whole bunch broke loose in an instant the wind whisked them all away and with them went george holding tight with both hands up up he sailed higher and higher the houses looked like toy houses and the people like dolls george was frightened he held on very tight at first the wind blew in great gusts then it quieted finally it sropped blowing altogether george was very tired down down he went bump on to the top of a traffic light everyone was surprised the traffic got all mixed up george didn’t know what to do and then he heard someone call george he looked down and saw his friend the man with the big yellow hat george was very happy the man was happy roo george slid down the post and the man with the big yellow hat put him under his arm then he paid the balloon man for all the balloons and then george and the man climbed into the car and at last away they went to the zoo what a nice place for george to live a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth back and forth back and forth and while she held him she sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my baby you’ll be the baby grew he grew and he grew and he grew he grew until he was two years old and he ran all around the house he grew until he was two years old and he ran all around the house he pulled all the food out of the refrigerator and he took his mother’s watch and flushed it down the toilet sometimes his mother would say this kid is driving me crazy but at night time when that two year old was quiet she opened the door to his room crawled across the floor looked up over the side of his bed and if he was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth back and forth back and forth while she rocked him she sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my baby you’ll be the little boy grew he grew and he grew and he grew he grew until he was nine years old and he never wanted to come in for dinner he never wanted to take a bath and when grandma visited he always said bad words sometimes his mother wanted to sell him to the zoo but at nighttime when he was asleep the mother quietly opened the door to his room crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed if he was really asleep she picked up that nine year old boy and rocked him back and forth back and forth back and forth and while she rocked him she sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my baby you’ll be the boy grew he grew and he grew and he grew he grew until he was a teenager he had strange friends and he wore strange clothes and he listened to strange music sometimes the mother felt like she was in a zoo but at nighttime when that teenager was asleep the mother opened the door to his room crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed if he was really asleep she picked up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth back and forth back and forth while she rocked him she sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my baby you’ll be that teenager grew he grew and he grew and he grew he grew until he was a grown up man he left home and got a house across town but sometimes on dark nights the mother got into her car and drove across town if all the lights in her son’s house were out she opened his bedroom window crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of his bed if that great big man was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth back and forth back and forth and while she rocked him she sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my baby you’ll be well that mother she got older she got older and older and older one day she called up her son and said you’d better come see me because i’m very old and sick so her son came to see her when he came in the door she tried to sing the song she sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always but she couldn’t finish because she was too old and sick the son went to his mother he picked her up and rocked her back and forth back and forth back and forth and he sang this song i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my mommy you’ll be when the son came home that night he stood for a long rime at the top of the stairs then he went into the room where his very new baby daughter was sleeping he picked her up in his arms and very slowly rocked her back and forth back and forth back and forth and while he rocked her he sang i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i’m living my baby you’ll be a little boy planted a carrot seed his mother said i’m afraid it won’t come up his father said im afraid it won’t come up and his big brother said it won’t come up every day the little boy pulled up the weeds around the seed and sprinkled the ground with water but nothing came up and nothing came up everyone kept saying it wouldn’t come up but he still pulled up the weeds around it every day and sprinkled the ground with water ande then one day a carrot came up just as the little boy had known it would one winter morning peter woke up and looked out the window snow had fallen during the night it covered everything as far as he could see after breakfast he put on his snowsuit and ran outside the snow was piled up very high along the street to make a path for walking crunch crunch crunch his feet sank into the snow he walked with his toes pointing out like this he walked with his toes pointing in like that then he dragged his feet s l o w l y to make tracks and he found something sticking out of the snow that made a new track i was a stick a stick that was just right for smacking a snow covered tree down fell the snow plop on top of peter’s head he thought it would be fun to join the big boys in their snowball fight but he knew he wasn’t old enough not yet so he made a smiling snowman and he made angels he pretended he was a mountain climber he climbed up a great big tall heaping mound of snow and slid all the way down he picked up a handful of snow and another and still another he packed it round and firm and put the snowball in his pocket for tomorrow then he went into his warm house he told his mother all about his adventures while she took off his wet socks and he thought and thought and thought about them before he got into bed he looked in his pocket his pocket was empty the snowball wasn’t there he felt very sad while he slept he dreamed that the sun had melted all the snow away but when he woke up his dream was gone the snow was still everywhere new snow was falling after breakfast he called to his friend from across the hall and they went out together into the deep deep snow once there was a peddler who sold caps but he was not like an ordinary peddler carrying his wares on his back he carried them on top of his head first he had on his own checked cap then a bunch of gray caps then a bunch of brown caps then a bunch of blue caps and on the very top a bunch of red caps he walked up and down the streets holding himself very straight so as not to upset his caps as he went along he called caps caps for sale fifty cents a cap one morning he couldn’t sell any caps he walked up the street and he walked down the street calling caps caps for sale fifty cents a cap but nobody wanted any caps that morning nobody wanted even a red cap he began to feel very hungry but he had no money for lunch i think i’ll go for a walk in the country said he and he walked out of town slowly slowly so as not to upset his caps he walked for a long time until he came to a great big tree that’s a nice place for a rest thought he and he sat down very slowly under the tree and leaned hack little by little against the tree trunk so as not to disturb the caps on his head then he put up his hand to feel if they were straight first his own checked cap then the gray caps then the brown caps then the blue caps then the red caps on the very top they were all there so he went to sleep he slept for a long time when he woke up he was refreshed and rested but before standing up he felt with his hand to make sure his caps were in the right place all he felt was his own checked cap he looked to the right of him no caps he looked to the left of him no caps he looked in back of him no caps he looked behind the tree no caps then he looked up into the tree and what do you think he saw on every branch sat a monkey on every monkey was a gray or a brown or a blue or a red cap the peddler looked at the monkeys the monkeys looked at the peddler he didn’t know what to do finally he spoke to them you monkeys you he said shaking a finger at them you give me back my caps but the monkeys only shook their fingers back at him and said tsz tsz tsz this made the peddler angry so he shook both hands at them and said you monkeys you you give me back my caps but the monkeys only shook both their hands back at him and said tsz tsz tsz now he felt quite angry he stamped his foot and he said you monkeys you you better give me back my caps but the monkeys only stamped their feet back at him and said tsz tsz tsz by this time the peddler was really very very angry he stamped both his feet and shouted you monkeys you you must give me back my caps but the monkeys only stamped both their feet back at him and said tsz tsz tsz at last he became so angry that he pulled off his own cap threw it on the ground and began to walk away but then each monkey pulled off his cap and all the gray caps and all the brown caps and all the blue caps and all the red caps came flying down out of the tree so the peddler picked up his caps and put them back on his head first his own checked cap then the gray caps then the brown caps then the blue caps then the red caps on the very top and slowly slowly he walked back to town calling caps caps for sale fifty cents a cap little nutbrown hare who was going to bed held on tight to big nutbrown hare’s very long ears he wanted to be sure that big nutbrown hare was listening guess how much i love you he said oh i don’t think i could guess that said big nutbrown hare this much said little nutbrown hare stretching out his arms as wide as they could go big nutbrown hare had even longer arms but i love

love you all the way down the lane as far as the river cried little nutbrown hare i love you across the river and over the hills said big nutbrown hare that’s very far thought little nutbrown hare he was almost too sleepy to think anymore then he looked beyond the thornbushes out into the big dark night nothing could be farther than the sky i love you right up to the moon he said and closed his eyes oh that’s far said big nutbrown hare that is very very far big nutbrown hare settled little nutbrown hare into his bed of leaves he leaned over and kissed him good night then he lay down close by and whispered with a smile i love you right up to the moon and back one evening after thinking it over for some time harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight there wasn’t any moon and harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight and he needed something to walk on he made a long straight path so he wouldn’t get lost and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him but he didn’t seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path so he left the path for a short cut across a field and the moon went with him the short cut led right to where harold thought a forest ought to be he didn’t want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with just one tree in it it turned out to be an apple tree the apples would be very tasty harold thought when they got red so he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples it was a terribly frightening dragon it even frightened harold he backed away his hand holding the purple crayon shook suddenly he realized what was happening but by then harold was over his head in an ocean he came up thinking fast and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat he quickly set sail and the moon sailed along with him after he had sailed long enough harold made land without much trouble he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was the sandy beach reminded harold of picnics and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch there was nothing but pie but there were all nine kinds of pie that harold liked best when harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste so harold left a very hungry moose and a deserving porcupine to finish it up and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see so he decided to make the hill into a mountain if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom he was tired and he felt he ought to be getting to bed he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain but as he looked down over the other side he slipped and there wasn’t any other side of the mountain he was falling in thin air but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn’t see his window he couldn’t even see a house so he made a house with windows and he landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard none of the windows was his window he tried to think where his window ought to be he made some more windows he made a big building full of windows he made lots of building full of windows he made a whole city full of windows but none of the windows was his window he couldn’t think where it might be he decided to ask a policeman the policeman pointed the way harold was going anyway but harold thanked him and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed then suddenly harold remembered he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon and then harold made his bed he got in it and drew up the covers the purple crayon dropped on the floor and harold dropped off to sleep and harold dropped off to sleep when my great gramma anna came to america she wore the same thick overcoat and big boots he had worn for farm work but her family weren’t dirt farmers anymore in new york city her father’s work was hauling things on a wagon and the rest of the family made artificial flowers all day everyone was in a hurry and it was so crowded not like in backhome russia but all the same it was their home and most of their neighbors were just like them when anna went to school english sounded to her like pebbles dropping into shallow water shhhhhh shhhhhh shhhhhh in six months she was speaking english her parents almost never learned so she spoke english for them too the only things she had left of backhome russia were her dress and the babushka she liked to throw up into the air when she was dancing and her dress was getting too small after her mother had sewn her a new one she took her old dress and babushka then from a basket of old clothes she took uncle vladimir’s shirt aunt havalah’s nightdress and an apron of aunt natasha’s we will make a quilt to help us always remember home anna’s mother said it will be like having the family in backhome russia dance around us at night and so it was anna’s mother invited all the neighborhood ladies they cut out animals and flowers from the scraps of clothing anna kept the needles threaded and handed them to the ladies as they needed them the border of the quilt was made of anna’s babushka on friday nights anna’s mother would say the prayers that started the sabbath the family ate challah and chicken soup the quilt was the tablecloth anna grew up and fell in love with great grandpa sasha to show he wanted to be her husband he gave anna a gold coin a dried flower and a piece of rock salt all tied into a linen handkerchief the gold was for wealth the flower for love and the salt so their lives would have flavor she accepted the hankie they were engaged under the wedding huppa anna and sasha promised each other love and understanding after the wedding the men and women celebrated separately when my grandma carle was born anna wrapped her daughter in the quilt to welcome her warmly into the world carle was given a gift of gold flower salt and bread gold so she would never know poverty a flower so she would always know love salt so her life would always have flavor and bread so that she would never know hunger carle learned to keep the sabbath and to cook and clean and do washing married you’ll be someday anna told carle and again the quilt became a wedding huppa this time for carle’s wedding to grandpa george men and women celebrated together but they still did not dance together in carle’s wedding bouquet was a gold coin bread and salt carle and george moved to a farm in michigan and great gramma anna came to live with them the quilt once again wrapped a new little girl mary ellen mary ellen called anna lady gramma she had grown very old and was sick a lot of the time the quilt kept her legs warm on anna’s ninety eighth birthday the cake was a kulich a rich cake with raisins and candied fruit in it when great gramma anna died prayers were said to lift her soul to heaven my mother mary ellen was now grown up when mary ellen left home she took the quilt with her when she became a bride the quilt became her huppa for the first time friends who were not jews came to the wedding my mother wore a suit but in her bouquet were gold bread and salt the quilt welcomed me patricia into the world and it was the tablecloth for my first birthday party at night i would trace my fingers around the edges of each animal on the quilt before i went to sleep i told my mother stories about the animals on the quilt she told me whose sleeve had made the horse whose apron had made the chicken whose dress had made the flowers and whose babushka went around the edge of the quilt the quilt was a pretend cape when i was in the bullring or sometimes a tent in the steaming amazon jungle at my wedding to enzo mario men and women danced together in my bouquet were gold bread and salt and a sprinkle of wine so i would always know laughter twenty years ago i held traci denise in the quilt for the first time someday she too will leave home and she will take the quilt with her that summer the fence that stretched through our town seemed bigger we lived in a yellow house on one side of it white people lived on the other and mama said don’t climb over that fence when you play she said it wasn’t safe that summer there was a girl who wore a pink sweater each morning she climbed up on the fence and stared over at our side sometimes i stared back she never sat on that fence with anybody that girl didn’t once when we were jumping rope she asked if she could play and my friend sandra said no without even asking the rest of us i don’t know what i would have said maybe yes maybe no that summer everyone and everything on the other side of that fence seemed far away when i asked my mama why she said because that’s the way things have always been sometimes when me and mama went into town i saw that girl with her mama she looked sad sometimes that girl did don’t stare my mama said it’s not polite it rained a lot that summer on rainy days that girl sat on the fence in a raincoat she let herself get all wet and acted like she didn’t even care sometimes i saw her dancing around in puddles splashing and laughing mama wouldn’t let me go out in the rain that’s why i bought you rainy day toys my mama said you stay inside here where it’s warm and safe and dry but every time it rained i looked for that girl and i always found her somewhere near the fence someplace in the middle of the summer the rain stopped when i walked outside the grass was damp and the sun was already high up in the sky and i stood there with my hands up in the air i felt brave that day i felt free i got close to the fence and that girl asked me my name clover i said my name’s annie she said annie paul i live over yonder she said by where you see the laundry that’s my blouse hanging on the line she smiled then she had a pretty smile and then i smiled and we stood there iooking at each other smiling lt’s nice up on this fence annie said you can see all over i ran my hand along the fence i reached up and touched the top of it a fence like this was made for sitting on annie said she looked at me sideways my mama says i shouldn’t go on the other side i said my mama says the same thing but she never said nothing about sitting on it neither did mine i said that summer me and annie sat together on that fence and when sandra and them looked at me funny i just made believe i didn’t care some mornings my mama watched us i waited for her to tell me to get down from that fence before i break my neck or something but she never did l see you made a new friend she said one morning and i nodded and mama smiled that summer me and annie sat on that fence and watched the whole wide world around us one day sandra and them were jumping rope near the fence and we asked if we could play i don’t care sandra said and when we jumped sandra and me were partners the way we used to be when we were too tired to jump anymore we sat up on the fence all of us in a long line someday somebody’s going to come along and knock this old fence down annie said and i nodded yeah i said someday good night gorilla good night elephant good night lion good night hyena good night giraffe good night armadillo good night dear good night good night good night good night good night good night good night good night zoo good night dear good night good night gorilla zzzz in an old house in paris that was covered with vines lived twelve little girls in two straight lines in two straight lines they broke their bread and brushed their teeth and went to bed the smiled at the good and frowned at the bad and sometimes they were very sad the left the house at half past nine in two straight lines in rain or shine the smallest one was madeline she was not afraid of mice she loved winter snow and ice to the tiger at the zoo madeline just said pooh pooh and nobody knew so well how to frighten miss clavel in the middle of one night miss clavel turned on her light and said something is not right little madeline sat in bed cried and cried her eyes were red and soon after dr cohn came he rushed out to the phone and he dialed danton tex six nurse he said it’s an appendix everybody had to cry not a single eye was dry madeline was in his arm in a blanket safe and warm in a car with a red light they drove into the night madeline woke up two hours later in a room with flowers madeline soon ate and drank on her bed there was a crank and a crack on the ceiling had the habit of sometimes looking like a rabbit outside were birds trees and sky and so ten days passed quickly by one nice morning miss clavel said isn’t this a fine day to visit madeline visitors from two to four read a sign outside her door tiptoeing with solemn face with some flowers and a vase in they walked then said ahhh when they saw the toys and candy and the dollhouse from papa but the biggest surprise by far on her stomach was a scar good by they said we’ll come again and the little girls left in the rain they went home and broke their bread brushed their teeth and went to bed in the middle of the night miss clavel turned on the light and said something is not right and afraid of a disaster miss clavel ran fast and faster and she said please children do tell me what is troubling you and all the litle girls cried boohoo we want our appendix out too good night little girls thank the lord you are well and now go to sleep said miss clavel and she turned out the light and closed the door and that’s all there is there isn’t any more mr and mrs mallard were looking for a place to live but every time mr mallard saw what looked like a nice place mrs mallard said it was no good there was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes or turtles so the flew on and on when they got to boston they felt too tired to fly any further there was a nice pond in the public garden with a little island on it the very place to spend the night quacked mr mallard so down they flapped next morning they fished for their breakfast in the mud at the bottom on the pond but they didn’t find much just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange enormous bird came by it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back good morning quacked mr mallard being polite the big bird was too proud to answer but the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water so the mallards followed them all round the pond and got another breakfast better than the first i like this place said mrs mallard as they climbed out on the bank and waddled along why don’t we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond there are no foxes and no turtles and the people feed us peanuts what could be better good said mr mallard delighted that at last mrs mallard had found a place that suited her but look out squawked mrs mallard all of a dither you’ll get run over and when she got her breath she added this is no place for babies with all those horrid things rushing about we’ll have to look somewhere else so they flew over beacon hill and round the state house but there was no place there they looked in louisburg square but there as no water to swim in then they flew over the charles river this is better quacked mr mallard that island looks like a nice quiet place and it’s only a little way from the public garden yes said mrs mallard remembering the peanuts that looks like just the right place to hatch ducklings so they chose a cozy spot among the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest and only just in time for now they were beginning to molt all their old wing feathers started to drop out and they would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the park on the river bank and they met a policeman called michael michael fed them peanuts and after that the mallards called on michael every day after mrs mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn’t go visit michael any more because she had to sit on the eggs and keep them warm she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her lunch or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there one day the ducklings hatched out first came jack then kack and then lack then mack and nack and ouach and pack and quack mr and mrs mallard were bursting with price it was a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and it kept them very busy one day mr mallard decided he’d like to take a trip to see what the rest of the river was like further on so off he set i’ll meet you in a week in the public garden he quacked over his shoulder take care of the ducklings don’t you worry said mrs mallard i know all about bringing up children and she did she taught them how to swim and dive she taught them to walk in a line to come when they were called and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels when at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them she said one morning come along children follow me before you could wink and eyelash jack kack mack nack ouack pack and quack fell into line just as they had been taught mrs mallard led the way into the water and they swam behind her to the opposite bank there they waded ashore and waddled along till they came to the highway mrs mallard stepped out to cross the road honk honk went the horns on the speeding cars qua a ack went mrs mallard as she tumbled back again quack quack quack quack went jack kack mack nack ouack pack and quack just as loud as their little quackers could quack the cars kept speeding by and honking and mrs mallard and the ducklings kept right on quack quack quacking they made such a noise that michael came running waving his arms and blowing his whistle he planted himself in the center of the road raised one hand to stop the traffic and then beckoned with the other the way policemen do for mrs mallard to cross over as soon as mrs mallard and the ducklings were safe on the other side and on their way down mount vernon street michael rushed back to his police booth he called clancy at headquarters and said there’s a family of ducks walkin down the street clancy said family of what ducks yelled michael send a police car quick meanwhile mrs mallard had reached the corner book shop and turned into charles street with jack kack mack nack ouack pack and quack all marching in line behind her everyone stared an old lady from beacon hill said isn’t it amazing and a man who swept the streets said well now ain’t that nice and when mrs mallard heard them she was so proud she tipped her nose in the air and walked along with and extra swing in her waddle when they came to the corner of beacon street there was the police car with four policemen that clancy had sent from headquarters the policemen held back the traffic so mrs mallard and the ducklings could march across the street right on into the public garden inside the gate they all turned round to say thank you to the policemen the policemen smiled and waved good by when they reached the pond and swam across to the little island there was mr mallard waiting for them just as he had promised the ducklings liked the new island so much that they decided to live there all day long they follow the swan boats and eat peanuts and when night falls they swim to their little island and go to sleep david’s mom always said no david no david no david no no no no come back here david david be quiet don’t play with your food that’s enough david go to your room settle down stop that this instant put your toys away not in the house david i said no david davey come here yes david i love you it was late one winter night long past my bedtime when pa and i went owling there was no wind the trees stood still as giant statues and the moon was so bright the sky seemed to shine somewhere behind us a train whistle blew long and low like a sad sad song i could hear it through the woolen cap pa had pulled down over my ears a farm dog answered the train and then a second dog joined in they sang out trains and dogs for a real long time and when their voices faded away it was as quiet as a dream we walked on toward to woods pa and i our feet crunched over the crisp snow and little gray footprints followed us pa made a long shadow but mine was short and round i had to run after him every now and then to keep up and my short round shadow bumped after me but i never called out if you go owling you have to be quiet that’s what pa always says i had been waiting to go owling with pa for a long long time we reached the line of pine trees black and pointy against the sky and pa held up his hand i stopped right where i was and waited he looked up as if searching the stars as if reading a map up there the moon made his face into a silver mask then he called whoo whoo who who who whoooooooo the sound of a great horned owl whoo whoo who who who whoooooooo again he called out and then again after each call he was silent and for a moment we both listened but there was no answer pa shrugged and i shrugged i was not disappointed my brothers all said sometimes there’s an owl and sometimes there isn’t we walked on i could feel the cold as if someone’s icy hand was palm down on my back and my nose and the tops of my cheeks felt cold and hot at the same time but i never said a word if you go owling you have to be quiet and make your own heat we went into the woods the shadows were the blackest things i had ever seen they stained the white snow my mouth felt furry for the scarf over it was wet and warm i didn’t ask what kinds of things hide behind black trees in the middle of the night when you go owling you have to be brave then we came to a clearing in the dark woods the moon was high above us it seemed to fit exactly over the center of the clearing and the snow below it was whiter than the milk in a cereal bowl i sighed and pa held up his hand at the sound i put my mittens over the scarf over my mouth and listened hard and then pa called whoo whoo who who who whoooooooo whoo whoo who who who whoooooooo i listened and looked so hard my ears hurt and my eyes got cloudy with the cold pa raised his face to call out again but before he could open his mouth an echo came threading its way through the trees whoo whoo who who who whoooooooo pa almost smiled then he called back whoo whoo who who who whoooooooo just as if he and the owl were talking about supper or about the woods or the moon or the cold i took my mitten off the scarf off my mouth and i almost smiled too the owl’s call came closer from high up in the trees on the edge of the meadow nothing in the meadow moved all of a sudden an owl shadow part of the big tree shadow lifted off and flew right over us we watched silently with the heat of our mouths the heat of all those words we had not spoken the shadow hooted again pa turned on his big flashlight and caught the owl just as it was landing on a branch for one minute three minutes maybe even a hundred minutes we stared at one another then the owl pumped its great wings and lifted off the branch like a shadow without sound it flew back into the forest time to go home pa said to me i knew then i could talk i could even laugh out loud but i was a shadow as we walked home when you go owling you don’t need words or warm or anything but hope that’s what pa says the kind of hope that flies on silent wings under a shining owl moon in a warm and sultry forest far far away there once lived a mother fruit bat and her new baby oh how mother bat loved her soft tiny baby i’ll name you stellaluna she crooned each night mother bat would carry stellaluna clutched to her breast as she flew out to search for food one night as mother bat followed the heavy scent of ripe fruit an owl spied her on silent wings the powerful bird swooped down upon the bats dodging and shrieking mother bat tried to escape but the owl struck again and again knocking stellaluna into the air her baby wings were as limp and useless as wet paper down down she went faster and faster into the forest below the dark leafy tangle of branches caught stellaluna as she fell one twig was small enough for stellaluna’s tiny feet wrapping her wings about her she clutched the thin branch trembling with cold and fear mother stellaluna squeaked where are you by drybreak the baby bat could hold on no longer down down again she dropped flump stellaluna landed headfirst in a soft downy nest startling the three baby birds who lived there stellaluna quickly clambered from the nest and hung out of sight below it she listened to the babble of the three birds what was that cried flap i don’t know but it’s hanging by its feet chirped flitter shhh here comes mama hissed pip many many times that day mama bird flew away always returning with food for her babies stellaluna was terribly hungry but not for the crawly things mama bird brought finally though the little bat could bear it no longer she climbed into the nest closed her eyes and opened her mouth plop in dropped a big green grasshopper stellaluna learned to be like the birds she stayed awake all day and slept at night she ate bugs even though they tasted awful her bat ways were quickly disappearing except for one thing stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet once when mama was away the curious baby birds decided to try it too when mama bird came home she saw eight tiny feet gripping the edge of the nest eeeek she cried get back up here this instant you’re going to fall and break your necks the birds clambered back into the nest but mama bird stopped stellaluna you are teaching my children to do bad things i will not let you back into this nest unless you promise to obey all the rules of this house stellaluna promised she ate bugs without making faces she slept in the nest at night and she didn’t hang by her feet stellaluna behaved as a good bird should all the babies grew quickly soon the nest became crowded mama bird told them it was time to learn to fly one by one pip flitter flap and stellaluna jumped from the nest their wings worked i’m just like them thought stellaluna i can fly too pip flitter and flap landed gracefully on a branch stellaluna tried to do the same how embarrassing i will fly all day stellaluna told herself then no one will see how clumsy i am the next day pip flitter flap and stellaluna went flying far from home they flew for hours exercising their new wings the sun is setting warned flitter we had better go home or we will get lost in the dark said flap but stellaluna had flown far ahead and was nowhere to be seen the three anxious birds went home without her all alone stellaluna flew and flew until her wings ached and she dropped into a tree i promised not to hang by my feet stellaluna sighed so she hung by her thumbs and soon fell asleep she didn’t hear the soft sound of wings coming near hey a loud voice said why are you hanging upside down stellaluna’s eyes opened wide she saw a most peculiar face i’m not upside down you are stellaluna said ah but you’re a bat bats hang by their feet you are hanging by your thumbs so that makes you upside down the creature said i’m a bat i am hanging by my feet that makes me right side up stellaluna was confused mama bird told me i was upside down she said i was wrong wrong for a bird maybe but not for a bat more bats gathered around to see the strange young bat who behaved like a bird stellaluna told them her story you ate b bugs stuttered one you slept at night gasped another how very strange they all murmured wait wait let me look at this child a bat pushed through the crowd an owl attacked you she asked sniffing stellaluna’s fur she whispered you are stellaluna you are my baby you escaped the owl cried stellaluna you survived yes said mother bat as she wrapped her wings around stellaluna come with me and i’ll show you where to find the most delicious fruit you’ll never have to eat another bug as long as you live but it’s nighttime stellaluna squeaked we can’t fly in the dark or we will crash into trees we’re bats said mother bat we can see in darkness come with us stellaluna was afraid but she let go of the tree and dropped into the deep blue sky stellaluna could see she felt as though rays of light shone from her eyes she was able to see everything in her path soon the bats found a mango tree and stellaluna ate as much of the fruit as she could hold i’ll never eat another bug as long as i live cheered stellaluna as she stuffed herself full i must tell pip flitter and flap the next day stellaluna went to visit the birds come with me and meet my bat family said stellaluna okay let’s go agreed pip they hang by their feet and they fly at night and they eat the best food in the world stellaluna explained to the birds on the way as the birds flew among the bats flap said i feel upside down here so the birds hung by their feet wait until dark stellaluna said excitedly we will fly at night when night came stellaluna flew away pip flitter and flap leapt from the tree to follow her i can’t see a thing yelled pip neither can i howled flitter aaeee shrieked flap they’re going to crash gasped stellaluna i must rescue them stellaluna swooped about grabbing her friends in the air she lifted them to a tree and the birds grasped a branch stellaluna hung from the limb above them we’re safe said stellaluna then she sighed i wish you could see in the dark too we wish you could land on your feet flitter replied pip and flap nodded they perched in silence for a long time how can we be so different and feel so much alike mused flitter and how can we feel so different and be so much alike wondered pip i think this is quite a mystery flap chirped i agree said stellaluna but we’re friends and that’s a fact bat notes of the nearly 4,000 species of mammals on earth almost one quarter are bats the only mammals capable of powered flight the scientific name for bats in chiroptera hand wing because the skeleton that supports the wing is composed on the animal’s elongated finger bones the majority of bats are classified as microchiroptera small hand wing nearly 800 varieties fill special niches in every climate around the world except the polar zones the lifestyles and food preferences of microchiroptera vary wildly many eat insects while others catch fish amphibians and reptiles finally there is the famous vampire of which there are only three species ranging from mexico to argentina the vampire’s victims are mostly domestic cattle and native mammals and birds the other 170 or so species of bats are the fruit bats otherwise known as megachiroptera or large hand wing as their name implies they are the largest bats some types boasting wingspans of six feet fruit bats generally have long muzzles large eyes pointy ears and furry bodies which is why they are often called flying foxes unlike microchiroptera who travel by echolocation fruit bats depend on their keen vision and sense of smell to navigate they live in tropical and subtropical climates that provide year round supplies of their favorite fruit flowers and nectar some fruit bats as they forage for nectar are responsible for pollination of many types of night blooming trees and plants others eat whole fruits seeds and all and distribute the seeds over the forest floor in their droppings regeneration of tropical forests depends greatly on bats sylvester duncan lived with his mother and father at acorn road in oatsdale one of his hobbies was collecting pebbles of unusual shape and color on a rainy saturday during vacation he found a quite extraordinary one it was flaming red shiny and perfectly round like a marble as he was studying this remarkable pebble he began to shiver probably from excitement and the rain felt cold on his back i wish it would stop raining he said to his great surprise the rain stopped it didn’t stop gradually as rains usually do it ceased the drops vanished on the way down the clouds disappeared everything was dry and the sun was shining as if rain had never existed in all his young life sylvester had never had a wish gratified so quickly it struck him that magic must be at work and he guessed that the magic must be in the remarkable looking red pebble where indeed it was to make a test he put the pebble on the ground and said i wish it would rain again nothing happened but when he said the same thing holding the pebble in his hoof the sky turned black there was lightning and a clap of thunder and the rain came shooting down what a lucky day this is thought sylvester from now on i can have anything i want my father and mother can have anything they want my relatives my friends and anybody at all can have everything anybody wants he wished the sunshine back in the sky and he wished a wart on his left hind fetlock would disappear and it did and he started home eager to amaze his father and mother with his magic pebble he could hardly wait to see their faces maybe they wouldn’t even believe him at first as he was crossing strawberry hill thinking of some of the many many things he could wish for he was startled to see a mean hungry lion looking right at him from behind some tall grass he was frightened if he hadn’t been so frightened he could have made the lion disappear or he could have wished himself safe at home with his father and mother he could have wished the lion would turn into a butterfly or a daisy or a gnat he could have wished many things but he panicked and couldn’t think carefully i wish i were a rock he said and he became a rock the lion came bounding over sniffed the rock a hundred times walked around and around it and went away confused perplexed puzzled and bewildered i saw that little donkey as clear as day maybe i’m going crazy he muttered and there was sylvester a rock on strawberry hill with the magic pebble lying right beside him on the ground and he was unable to pick it up oh how i wish i were myself again he thought but nothing happened he had to be touching the pebble to make the magic work but there was nothing he could do about it his thoughts began to race like mad he was scared and worried being helpless he felt hopeless he imagined all the possibilities and eventually he realized that his only chance of becoming himself again was for someone to find the red pebble and to wish that the rock next to it would be a donkey someone would surely find the red pebble it was so bright and shiny but what on earth would make them wish that a rock were a donkey the chance was one in a billion at best sylvester fell asleep what else could he do night came with many stars meanwhile back at home mr and mrs duncan paced the floor frantic with worry sylvester had never come home later than dinner time where could he be they stayed up all night wondering what had happened expecting that sylvester would surely turn up by morning but he didn’t of course mrs duncan cried a lot and mr duncan did his best to soothe her both longed to have their dear son with them i will never scold sylvester again as long as i live said mrs duncan no matter what he does at dawn they went about inquiring of all the neighbors they talked to all the children the puppies the kittens the colts the piglets no one had seen sylvester since the day before yesterday they went to the police the police could not find their child all the dogs in oatsdale went searching for him they sniffed behind every rock and tree and blade of grass into every nook and gully of the neighborhood and beyond but found not a scent of him they sniffed the rock on strawberry hill but it smelled like a rock it didn’t smell like sylvester after a month of searching the same places over and over again and inquiring of the same animals over and over again mr and mrs duncan no longer knew what to do they concluded that something dreadful must have happened and that they would probably never see their son again though all the time he was less than a mile away they tried their best to be happy to go about their usual ways but their usual ways included sylvester and they were always reminded of him they were miserable life had no meaning for them any more night followed day and day followed night over and over again sylvester on the hill woke up less and less often when he was awake he was only hopeless and unhappy he felt he would be a rock forever and he tried to get used to it he went into an endless sleep the days grew colder fall came with the leaves changing color then the leaves fell and the grass bent to the ground then it was winter the winds blew this way and that it snowed mostly the animals stayed indoors living on the food they had stored up one day a wolf sat on the rock that was sylvester and howled and howled because he was hungry then the snows melted the earth warmed up in the spring sun and things budded leaves were on the trees again flowers showed their young faces one day in may mr duncan insisted that his wife go with him on a picnic let’s cheer up he said let us try to live again and be happy even though sylvester our angel is no longer with us they went to strawberry hill mrs duncan sat down on the rock the warmth of his own mother sitting on him woke sylvester up from his deep winter sleep how he wanted to shout mother father it’s me sylvester i’m right here but he couldn’t talk he had no voice he was stone dumb mr duncan walked aimlessly about while mrs duncan set out the picnic food on the rock alfalfa sandwiches pickled oats sassafras salad timothy compote suddenly mr duncan saw the red pebble what a fantastic pebble he exclaimed sylvester would have loved it for his collection he put the pebble on the rock they sat down to eat sylvester was now as wide awake as a donkey that was a rock could possibly be mrs duncan felt some mysterious excitement you know father she said suddenly i have the strangest feeling that our dear sylvester is still alive and not far away i am i am sylvester wanted to shout but he couldn’t if only he had realized that the pebble resting on his back was the magic pebble oh how i wish he were here with us on this lovely may day said mrs duncan mr duncan looked sadly at the ground don’t you wish it too father she said he looked at her as if to say how can you ask such a question mr and mrs duncan looked at each other with great sorrow i wish i were myself again i wish i were my real self again thought sylvester and in less than an instant he was you can imagine the scene that followed the embraces the kisses the questions the answers the loving looks and the fond exclamations when they had eventually calmed down a bit and had gotten home mr duncan put the magic pebble in an iron safe some day they might want to use it but really for now what more could they wish for they all had all that they wanted the end once there was a tree and she loved a little boy and every day the boy would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play king of the forest he would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches and eat apples and they would play hide and go seek and when he was tired he would sleep in her shade and the boy loved the tree very much and the tree was happy but time went by and the boy grew older and the tree was often alone then one day the boy came to the tree and the tree said come boy come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in my shade and be happy i am too big to climb and play said the boy i want to buy things and have fun i want some money can you give me some money i’m sorry said the tree but i have no money i have only leaves and apples take my apples boy and sell them in the city then you will have money and you will be happy and so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried them away and the tree was happy but the boy stayed away for a long time and the tree was sad and then one day the boy came back and the tree shook with joy and she said come boy climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy i am too busy to climb trees said the boy i want a house to keep me warm he said i want a wife and i want children and so i need a house can you give me a house i have no house said the tree the forest is my house but you may cut off my branches and build a house then you will be happy and so the boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house and the tree was happy but the boy stayed away for a long time and when he came back the tree was so happy she could hardly speak come boy she whispered come and play i am too old and sad to play said the boy i want a boat that will take me far away from here can you give me a boat cut down my trunk and make a boat said the tree then you can sail away and be happy and so the boy cut down her trunk and made a boat and sailed away and the tree was happy but not really and after a long time the boy came back again i am sorry boy said the tree but i have nothing left to give you my apples are gone my teeth are too weak for apples said the boy my branches are gone said the tree you cannot swing on them i am too old to swing on branches said the boy my trunk is gone said the tree you cannot climb i am too tired to climb said the boy i am sorry sighed the tree i wish that i could give you something but i have nothing left i am just an old stump i am sorry i don’t need very much now said the boy just a quiet place to sit and rest i am very tired well said the tree straightening herself up as much as she could well an old stump is good for sitting and resting come boy sit down sit down and rest and the boy did and the tree was happy the end on christmas eve many years ago i lay quietly in my bed i did not rustle the sheets i breathed slowly and silently i was listening for a sound a sound a friend had told me i’d never hear the ringing bells of santa’s sleigh there is no santa my friend has insisted but i knew he was wrong late that night i did hear sounds though not of ringing bells from outside came the sounds of hissing steam and squeaking metal i looked through my window and saw a train standing perfectly still in front of my house it was wrapped in an apron of steam snowflakes fell lightly around it a conductor stood at the open door of one of the cars he took a large pocket watch from his vest then looked up at my window i put on my slippers and robe i tiptoed downstairs and out the door all aboard the conductor cried out i ran up to him well he said are you coming where i asked why to the north pole of course was his answer this is the polar express i took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard the train was filled with other children all in their pajamas and nightgowns we sang christmas carols and ate candies with nougat centers as white as snow we drank hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars outside the lights of towns and villages flickered in the distance as the polar express raced northward soon there were no more lights to be seen we traveled through cold dark forests where lean wolves roamed and white tailed rabbits hid from our train as it thundered through the quiet wilderness we climbed mountains so high it seemed as if we would scrape the moon but the polar express never slowed down faster and faster we ran along rolling over peaks and through valleys like a car on a roller coaster the mountains turned into hills the hills to snow covered plains we crossed a barren desert of ice the great polar ice cap lights appeared in the distance they looked like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea there said the conductor is the north pole the north pole it was a huge city standing alone at the top of the world filled with factories where every christmas toy was made at first we saw no elves they are gathering at the center of the city the conductor told us that is where santa will give the first gift of christmas who receives the first gift we all asked the conductor answered he will choose one of you look shouted one of the children the elves outside we saw hundreds of elves as our train drew closer to the center of the north pole we slowed to a crawl so crowded were the streets with santa’s helpers when the polar express could go no farther we stopped and the conductor led us outside we pressed through the crowd to the edge of a large open circle in front of us stood santa’s sleigh the reindeer were excited they pranced and paced ringing the silver sleigh bells that hung from their harnesses it was a magical sound like nothing i’d ever heard across the circle the elves moved apart and santa claus appeared the elves cheered wildly he marched over to us and pointing to me said let’s have this fellow here he jumped into his sleigh the conductor handed me up i sat on santa’s knee and he asked now what would you like for christmas i knew that i could have any gift i could imagine but the thing i wanted most for christmas was not inside santa’s giant bag what i wanted more than anything was one silver bell from santa’s sleigh when i asked santa smiled then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer’s harness the elf tossed it up to santa he stood holding the bell high above him and called out the first gift of christmas a clock struck midnight as the elves roared their approval santa handed the bell to me and i put it in my bathrobe pocket the conductor helped me down from the sleigh santa shouted out the reindeer’s names and cracked his whip his team charged forward and climbed into the air santa circled once above us then disappeared in the cold dark polar sky as soon as we were back inside the polar express the other children asked to see the bell i reached into my pocket but the only thing i felt was a hole i had lost the silver bell from santa claus’s sleigh let’s hurry outside and look for it one of the children said but the train gave a sudden lurch and started moving we were on our way home it broke my heart to lose the bell when the train reached my house i sadly left the other children i stood at my doorway and waved good bye the conductor said something from the moving train but i couldn’t hear him what i yelled out he cupped his hands around his mouth merry christmas he shouted the polar express let out a loud blast from its whistle and sped away on christmas morning my little sister sarah and i opened our presents when it looked as if everything had been unwrapped sarah found one last small box behind the tree it had my name on it inside was the silver bell there was a note found this on the seat of my sleigh fix that hole in your pocket signed mr c i shook the bell it made the most beautiful sound my sister and i had ever heard but my mother said oh that’s too bad yes said my father it’s broken when i’d shaken the bell my parents had not heard a sound at one time most of my friends could hear the bell but as years passed it fell silent for all of them even sarah found one christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound though i’ve grown old the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe i wrote to the zoo to send me a pet they sent me an he was too big i sent him back so they sent me a he was too tall i sent him back so they sent me a he was too fierce i sent him back so they sent me a he was too grumpy i sent him back so they sent me a he was too scary i sent him back so they sent me a he was too naughty i sent him back so they sent me a he was too jumpy i sent him back so they thought very hard and sent me a he was perfect i kept him once upon a time there was a little house way out in the country she was a pretty little house and she was strong and well built the man who built her so well said this little house shall never be sold for gold or silver and she will live to see our great great grandchildren’s great great grandchildren living in her the little house was very happy as she sat on the hill and watched the countryside around her she watched the sun rise in the morning and she watched the sun set in the evening day followed day each one a little different form the one before but the little house stayed just the same in the nights she watched the moon grow from a thin new moon to a full moon then back again to a thin old moon and when there was no moon she watched the stars way off in the distance she could see the lights of the city the little house was curious about the city and wondered what it would be like to live there time passed quickly for the little house as she watched the countryside slowly change with the seasons in the spring when the days grew longer and the sun warmer she waited for the first robin to return from the south she watched the grass turn green she watched the buds on the trees swell and the apple trees burst into blossom she watched the children playing in the brook in the long summer days she sat in the sun and watched the trees cover themselves with leaves and the white daisies cover the hill she watched the gardens grow and she watched the apples turn red and ripen she watched the children swimming in the pool in the fall when the days grew shorter and the nights colder she watched the first frost turn the leaves to bright yellow and orange and red she watched the harvest gathered and the apples picked she watched the children going back to school in the winter when the nights were long and the days short and the countryside covered with snow she watched the children coasting and skating year followed year the apple trees grew old and new ones were planted the children grew up and went away to the city and now at night the lights of the city seemed brighter and closer one day the little house was surprised to see a horseless carriage coming down the winding country road pretty soon there were more of them on the road and fewer carriages pulled by horses pretty soon along came some surveyors and surveyed a line in front of the little house pretty soon along came a steam shovel and dug a road through the hill covered with daisies then some trucks came and dumped big stones on the road then some trucks with little stones then some trucks with tar and sand and finally a steam roller came and rolled it all smooth and the road was done now the little house watched the trucks and automobiles going back and forth to the city gasoline stations roadside stands and small houses followed the new road everyone and everything moved much faster now than before more roads were made and the countryside was divided into lots more houses and bigger houses apartment houses and tenement houses schools stores and garages spread over the land and crowded around the little house no one wanted to live in her and take care of her any more she couldn’t be sold for gold or silver so she just stayed there and watched now it was not so quiet and peaceful at night now the lights of the city were bright and very close and the street lights shone all night this must be living in the city thought the little house and didn’t know whether she liked it or not she missed the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight pretty soon there were trolley cars going back and forth in front of the little house they went back and forth all day and part of the night everyone seemed to be very busy and everyone seemed to be in a hurry pretty soon there was an elevated train going back and forth above the little house the air was filled with dust and smoke and the noise was so loud that it shook the little house now she couldn’t tell when spring came or summer or fall or winter it al seemed about the same pretty soon there was a subway going back and forth underneath the little house she couldn’t see it but she could feel and hear it people were moving faster and faster no one noticed the little house any more they hurried by without a glance pretty soon they tore down the apartment houses and tenement houses around the little house and started digging big cellars one on each side the steam shovels dug down three stories on one side and four stories on the other side pretty soon they started building up they built up twenty five stories on one side and thirty five stories on the other now the little house only saw the sun at noon and didn’t see the moon or starts at night at all because the lights of the city were too bright she didn’t like living in the city at night she used to dream of the country and the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight the little house was very sad and lonely her paint was cracked and dirty her windows were broken and her shutters hung crookedly she looked shabby though she was just as good a house as ever underneath then one fine morning in spring along came the great great granddaughter of the man who built the little house so well she saw the shabby little house but she didn’t hurry by there was something about the little house that made her stop and look again she said to her husband that little house looks just like the little house my grandmother lived in when she was a little girl only that little house was way out in the country on a hill covered with daisies and apple trees growing around the found out it was the very same house so the went to the movers to see if the little house could be moved the movers looked the little house all over and said sure this house is as good as ever she’s build so well we could move her anywhere so they jacked up the little house and put her on wheels traffic was held up for hours as they slowly moved her out of the city at first the little house was frightened but after she got used to it she rather liked it they rolled along the big road and they rolled along the little roads until they were way out in the country when the little house saw the green grass and heard the birds singing she didn’t feel sad any more they went along and along but they couldn’t seem to find just the right place they tried the little house here and they tried her there finally they saw a little hill in the middle of the field and apple trees growing around there said the great great granddaughter that’s just the place yes it is said the little house to herself a cellar was dug on top of the hill and slowly they moved the house from the road to the hill the windows and shutters were fixed and once again they painted her a lovely shade of pink as the little house settled down on her new foundation she smiled happily once again she could watch the sun and moon and stars once again she could watch spring and summer and fall and winter come and go once again she was lived in and taken care of never again would she be curious about the city never again would she want to live there the stars twinkled above her a new moon was coming up it was spring and all was peaceful in the country at the far end of town where grickle grass grows and the wind smells slow and sour when it blows and no birds ever sing expecting old crows is the street of the lifted lorax and deep in the grickle grass some people say if you look deep enough you can still see today where the lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the lorax away what was the lorax and why was it there and why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of town where the grickle grass grows the old once ler still lives here ask him he knows you won’t see the once ler don’t knock at his door he stays in his lerkim on top of his store he lurks in his lerkim cold under the roof where he makes his own clothes out of miff muffered moof and on special dank midnights in august he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the lorax was lifted away he’ll tell you perhaps if you’re willing to pay on the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a great great great grandfather snail then he pulls up the pail makes a most careful count to see if you’ve paid him the proper amount then he hides what you paid him away in his snuvv his secret strange hole in his gruvvulous glove then he grunts i will call you by whisper ma phone for the secrets i tell are for your ears alone slupp down slupps the whisper ma phone to your ear and the old once ler’s whispers are not very clear since they have to come down through a snergelly hose and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose now i’ll tell you he says with his teeth sounding gray how the lorax got lifted and taken away it all started way back such a long long time back what back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean and the song of the swomee swans rang out in space one morning i came to this glorious place and i first saw the trees the truffula trees the bright colored tufts of the truffula trees mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze and under the trees i saw brown bar ba loots frisking about in their bar ba loot suits as they played in the shade and ate truffula fruits from the rippulous pond came the comfortable sound of the humming fish humming while splashing around but those trees those trees those truffula trees all my life i’d been searching for trees such as these the touch of their tufts was much softer than silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk i felt a great leaping of joy in my heart i knew just what i’d do i unloaded my cart in no time at all i had built a small shop then i chopped down a truffula tree with one chop and with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed i took the soft tuft and i knitted a thneed the instant i’d finished i heard a ga zump i looked i saw something pop out of the stump of the tree i’d chopped down it was sort of a man describe him that’s hard i don’t know if i can he was shortish and oddish and brownish and mossy and he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy mister he said with a sawdusty sneeze i am the lorax i speak for the trees i speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues and i’m asking you sir at the top of my lungs he was very upset as he shouted and puffed what’s that thing you’ve made out of my turffula tuft look lorax i said there’s no cause for alarm i chopped just one tree i am doing no harm i’m being quite useful this thing is a thneed a thneed’s a fine something that all people need it’s a shirt it’s a sock it’s a glove it’s a hat but it has other uses yes far beyond that you can use it for carpets for pillows for sheets or curtains or covers for bicycle seats the lorax said sir you are crazy with greed there is no one on earth who would buy that fool thneed but the very next minute i proved he was wrong for just at the minute a chap came along and he thought that the thneed i had knitted was great he happily bought it for three ninety eight i laughed at the lorax you poor stupid guy you never can tell what some people will buy i repeat cried the lorax i speak for the trees i’m busy i told him shut up if you please i rushed cross the room and in no time at all built a radio phone i put in a quick call i called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and i said listen here here’s a wonderful chance for the whole once ler family to get mighty rich get over here fast take the road to north nitch turn left at weehawken sharp right at south stitch and in no time at all in the factory i built the whole once ler family was working full tilt we were all knitting thneeds just as busy as bees to the sound of the chopping of truffula trees then oh baby oh how my business did grow now chopping one tree at a time was too slow so i quickly invented my super axe hacker which whacked off four truffula trees at one smacker we were making thneeds four times as fast as before and that lorax he didn’t show up any more but the next week he knocked on my new office door he snapped i’m the lorax who speaks for the trees which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please but i’m also in charge of the brown bar ba loots who played in the shade in their bar ba loot suits and happily lived eating truffula fruits now thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground there’s not enough truffula fruit to go round and my poor bar ba loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas and no food in their tummies they loved living here but i can’t let them stay they’ll have to find food and i hope that they may good luck boys he cried and he sent them away i the once ler felt sad as i watched them all go but business is business and businesses must grow regardless of crummies in tummies you know i meant no harm i most truly did not but i had to grow bigger so bigger i got i biggered by factory i biggered my roads i biggered my wagons i biggered the loads of the thneeds i shipped out i was shipping them forth to the south to the east to the west to the north i went right on biggering selling more thneeds and i biggered my money which everyone needs then again he came back i was fixing some pipes with that old nuisance lorax came back with more gripes i am the lorax he coughed and he whiffed he sneezed and he snuffled he snarggled he sniffed once ler he cried with a cruffulous croak once ler you’re making such smogulous smoke my poor swomee swans why they can’t sing a note no on can sign who has smog in his throat and so said the lorax please pardon my cough they cannot live here so i’m sending them off where will they go i don’t hopefully know they may have to fly for a month or a year to escape from the smog you’ve smogged up around here what’s more snapped the lorax his dander was up let me say a few words about gluppity glupp your machinery chugs on day and night without stop making gluppity glupp also schloppity schlopp and what do you do with this leftover goo i’ll show you you dirty old once ler man you you’re glumping the pond where the humming fish hummed no more can they hum for their gills are all gummed so i’m sending them off oh their future is dreary they’ll walk on their fins and get woefully weary in search of some water that isn’t so smeary and then i got mad i got terribly mad i yelled at the lorax now listen here dad all you do is yap yap and say bad bad bad bad well i have my rights sir and i’m telling you i intend to go on doing just what i do and for your information you lorax i’m figgering on biggering and biggering and biggering and biggering turning more truffula trees into thneeds which everyone everyone everyone needs and at that very moment we heard a loud whack from outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe on a tree then we heard the tree fall the very last truffula tree of them all no more trees no more thneeds no more work to be done so in no time my uncles and aunts every one all waved me good bye they jumped into my cars and drove away under the smoke smuggered stars now all that was left neath the bad smelling sky was my big empty factory the lorax and i the lorax said nothing just gave me a glance just gave me a sad sad backward glance as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants and i’ll never forget the grim look on his face when he heisted himself and took leave of this place through a hole in the smog without leaving a trace and all the lorax left here in this mess was a small pile of rocks with one word unless whatever that meant well i just couldn’t guess that was long long ago but each day since that day i’ve sat here and worried and worried away through the years while my buildings have fallen apart i’ve worried about it with all of my heart but now says the once ler now that you’re here the word of the lorax seems perfectly clear unless someone like you cares a while awful lot nothing is going to get better it’s not so catch calls the once ler he lets something fall it’s a truffula seed it’s the last one of all you’re in charge of the last of the truffula seeds and truffula trees are what everyone needs plant a new truffula treat it with care give it clean water and feed it fresh air grow a forest protect it from axes that hack then the lorax and all of his friends may come back once there was a little bunny who wanted to run away so he said to his mother i am running away if you run away said his mother i will run after you for you are my little bunny if you run after me said the little bunny i will become a fish in a trout stream and i will swim away from you if you become a fish in a trout stream said his mother i will become a fisherman and i will fish for you if you become a fisherman said the little bunny i will become a rock on the mountain high above you if you become a rock on the mountain high above me said his mother i will be a mountain climber and i will climb to where you are if you become a mountain climber said the little bunny i will be a crocus in a hidden garden if you become a crocus in a hidden garden said his mother i will be a gardener and i will find you if you are a gardener and find me said the little bunny i will be a bird and fly away from you if you become a bird and fly away from me said his mother i will be a tree that you come home to if you become a tree said the little bunny i will become a little sailboat and i will sail away from you if you become a sailboat and sail away from me said his mother i will become the wind and blow you where i want you to go if you become the wind and blow me said the little bunny i will join a circus and fly away on a flying trapeze if you go flying on a flying trapeze said his mother i will be a tightrope walker and i will walk across the air to you if you become a tightrope walker and walk across the air said the bunny i will become a little boy and run into a house if you become a little boy and run into a house said the mother bunny i will become your mother and catch you in my arms and hug you shucks said the bunny i might just as well stay where i am and be your little bunny and so he did have a carrot said the mother bunny i went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there’s gum in my hair and when i got out of bed this morning i tripped on the skateboard and by mistake i dropped my sweater in the sink while the water was running and i could tell it was going to be a terrible horrible no good very bad day at breakfast anthony found a corvette sting ray car kit in his breakfast cereal box and nick found a junior undercover agent code ring in his breakfast cereal box but in my breakfast cereal box all i found was breakfast cereal i think i’ll move to australia in the car pool mrs gibson let becky have a sear by the window audrey and elliott got seats by the window too i said i was being scrunched i said i was being smushed i said if i don’t get a seat by the window i am going to be carsick no one even answered i could tell it was going to be a terrible horrible no good very bad day at school mrs dickens liked paul’s picture of the sailboat better than my picture of the invisible castle at singing time she said i sang too loud at counting time she said i left out sixteen who needs sixteen i could tell it was going to be a terrible horrible no good very bad day i could tell because paul said i wasn’t his best friend anymore he said that philip parker was his best friend and that albert moyo was his next best friend and that i was only his third best friend i hope you sit on a tack i said to paul i hope the next time you get a double decker strawberry ice cream cone the ice cream part falls off the cone part and lands in australia there were two cupcakes in philip parker’s lunch bag and albert got a hershey bar with almonds and paul’s mother gave him a piece of jelly roll that had little coconut sprinkles on the top guess whose mother forgot to put in dessert it was a terrible horrible no good very bad day that’s what it was because after school my mom took us all to the dentist and dr fields found a cavity just in me come back next week and i’ll fix it said dr fields next week i said i’m going to australia on the way downstairs the elevator door closed on my foot and while we were waiting for my mom to go get the car anthony made me fall where it was muddy and then when i started crying because of the mud nick said i was a crybaby and while i was punching nick for saying crybaby my mom came back with the car and scolded me for being muddy and fighting i am having a terrible horrible no good very bad day i told everybody no one even answered so then we went to the shoe store to buy some sneakers anthony chose white ones with blue stripes nick chose red ones with white stripes i chose blue ones with red stripes but then the shoe man said we’re all sold out they made me buy plain old white ones but they can’t make me wear them when we picked up my dad at his office he said i couldn’t play with his copying machine but i forgot he also said to watch out for the books on his desk and i was careful as could be except for my elbow he also said don’t fool around with his phone but i think i called australia my dad said please don’t pick him up anymore it was a terrible horrible no good very bad day there were lima beans for dinner and i hate limas there was kissing on tv and i hate kissing my bath was too hot i got soap in my eyes my marble went down the drain and i had to wear my railroad train pajamas i hate my railroad train pajamas when i went to bed nick took back the pillow he said i could keep and the mickey mouse night light burned out and i bit my tongue the cat wants to sleep with anthony not me it has been a terrible horrible no good very bad day my mom says some days are like that even in australia camilla cream loved lima beans but she never ate them all of her friends hated lima beans and she wanted to fit in camilla was always worried about what other people thought of her today she was fretting even more than usual it was the first day of school and she couldn’t decide what to wear there were so many people to impress she tried on forty two outfits but none seemed quite right she put on a pretty red dress and looked in the mirror then she screamed her mother ran into the room and she screamed too oh my heavens she cried you’re completely covered with stripes this was certainly true camilla was striped from head to toe she looked like a rainbow mrs cream felt camilla’s forehead do you feel all right she asked i feel fine camilla answered but just look at me you get back in bed this instant her mother ordered you’re not going to school today camilla was relieved she didn’t want to miss the first day of school but she was afraid of what the other kids would say and she had no idea what to wear with those crazy stripes that afternoon dr bumble came to examine camilla most extraordinary he exclaimed l’ve never seen anything like it are you having any coughing sneezing runny nose aches pains chills hot flashes dizziness drowsiness shortness of breath or uncontrollable twitching no camilla told him i feel fine well then dr bumble said turning to mrs cream l don’t see any reason why she shouldn’t go to school tomorrow here’s some ointment that should help clear up those stripes in a few days if it doesn’t you know where to reach me and off he went the next day was a disaster everyone at school laughed at camilla they called her camilla crayon and night of the living lollipop she tried her best to act as if everything were normal but when the class said the pledge of allegiance her stripes turned red white and blue and she broke out in stars the other kids thought this was great one yelled out let’s see some purple polka dots sure enough camilla turned all purple polka dotty someone else shouted checkerboard and a pattern of squares covered her skin soon everyone was calling out different shapes and colors and poor camilla was changing faster than you can change channels on a t.v that night mr harms the school principal called l’m sorry mrs cream he said i’m going to have to ask you to keep camilla home from school she’s just too much of a distraction and i’ve been getting calls from the other parents they’re afraid those stripes may be contagious camilla was so embarrassed she couldn’t believe that two days ago everyone liked her now nobody wanted to be in the same room with her her father tried to make her feel better is there anything i can get you sweetheart he asked no thank you sighed camilla what she really wanted was a nice plate of lima beans but she had been laughed at enough for one day hmm well yes i see dr bumble mumbled when mr cream phoned the next day i think i’d better bring in the specialists we’ll be right over about an hour later dr bumble arrived with four people in long white coats he introduced them to the creams this is dr grop dr sponge dr cricket and dr young then the specialists went to work on camilla they squeezed and jabbed tapped and tested it was very uncomfortable well it’s not the mumps concluded dr grop or the measles said dr sponge definitely not chicken pox put in dr cricket or sunburn said dr young try these said the specialists they each handed her a bottle filled with different colored pills take one of each before bed said dr grop then they filed out the front door followed by dr bumble that night camilla took her medicine it was awful when she woke up the next morning she did feel different but when she got dressed her clothes didn’t fit right she looked in the mirror and there staring back at her was a giant multi colored pill with her face on it dr bumble rushed over as soon as mrs cream called but this time instead of the specialists he brought the experts dr gourd and mr mellon were the finest scientific minds in the land once again camilla was poked and prodded looked at and listened to the experts wrote down lots of numbers then they huddled together and whispered dr gourd finally spoke it might be a virus he announced with authority suddenly fuzzy little virus balls appeared all over camilla or possibly some form of bacteria said mr mellon out popped squiggly little bacteria tails or it could be a fungus added dr gourd instantly camilla was covered with different colored fungus blotches the experts looked at camilla then at each other we need to go over these numbers again back at the lab dr gourd explained we’ll call you when we know something but the experts didn’t have a clue much less a cure by now the t.v news had found out about camilla reporters from every channel were outside her house telling the story of the bizarre case of the incredible changing kid soon a huge crowd was camped out on the front lawn the creams were swamped with all kinds of remedies from psychologists allergists herbalists nutritionists psychics an old medicine man a guru and even a veterinarian each so called cure only added to poor camilla’s strange appearance until it was hard to even recognize her she sprouted roots and berries and crystals and feathers and a long furry tail but nothing worked one day a woman who called herself an environmental therapist claimed she could cure camilla close your eyes she said breathe deeply and become one with your room i wish you hadn’t said that camilla groaned slowly she started to melt into the walls of her room her bed became her mouth her nose was a dresses and two paintings were her eyes the therapist screamed and ran from the house what are we going to do cried mrs cream it just keeps getting worse and worse she began to sob at that moment mr cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door he opened it and there stood an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry excuse me she said brightly but i think i can help she went into camilla’s room and looked around my goodness she said with a shake of her head what we have here is a bad case of stripes one of the worst i’ve ever seen she pulled a container of small green beans from her bag here she said these might do the trick are those magic beans asked mrs cream oh my ho replied the kind old woman there’s no such thing these are just plain old lima beans i’ll bet you’d like some wouldn’t you she asked camilla camilla wanted a big heaping plateful of lima beans more than just about anything but she was still afraid to admit it yuck she said no one likes lima beans especially me oh dear the old woman said sadly l guess i was wrong about you she put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door camilla watched the old woman walk away those beans would taste so good and being laughed at for eating them was nothing compared to what she’d been going through she finally couldn’t stand it wait she cried the truth is i really love lima beans l thought so the old woman said with a smile she took a handful of beans and popped them into camilla’s mouth mmmm said camilla suddenly the branches feathers and squiggly tails began to disappear then the whole room swirled around when it stopped there stood camilla and everything was back to normal i’m cured she shouted yes said the old woman i knew the real you was in there somewhere she patted camilla on the head then she went outside and vanished into the crowd afterward camilla wasn’t quite the same some of the kids at school said she was weird but she didn’t care a

steam shovel a beautiful red steam shovel her name was mary anne mike mulligan was very proud of mary anne he always said that she could dig as much in a day as a hundred men could dig in a week but he had never been quite sure that this was true mike mulligan and mary anne had been digging together for years and years mike mulligan took such good care of mary anne she never grew old it was mike mulligan and mary anne and some others who dug the great canals for the big boats to sail through it was mike mulligan and mary anne and some others who cut through the high mountains so that trains could go through it was mike mulligan and mary anne and some others who lowered the hills and straightened the curves to make the long highways for the automobiles it was mike mulligan and mary anne and some others who smoothed out the ground and filled in the holes to make the landing fields for the airplanes and it was mike mulligan and mary anne and some others who dug the deep holes for the cellars of the tall skyscrapers in the big cities when people used to stop and watch them mike mulligan and mary anne used to dig a little faster and a little better the more people stopped the faster and better they dug some days they would keep as many as thirty seven trucks busy taking away the dirt they had dug then along came the new gasoline shovels and the new electric shovels and the new diesel motor shovels and took all the jobs away from the steam shovels mike mulligan and mary anne were very sad all the other steam shovels were being sold for junk or left out in old gravel pits to rust and fall apart mike loved mary anne he couldn’t do that to her he had taken such good care of her that she could still dig as much in a day as a hundred men could dig in a week at least he thought she could but he wasn’t quite sure everywhere they went the new gas shovels and the new electric shovels and the new diesel motor shovels had all the jobs no one wanted mike mulligan and mary anne any more then one day mike read in a newspaper that the town of popperville was going to build a new town hall we are going to dig the cellar of that town hall said mike to mary anne and off they started they left the canals and the railroads and the highways and the airports and the big cities where no one wanted them anymore and went away out in the country they crawled along slowly up the hills and down the hills till they came to the little town of popperville when they got there they found that the selectmen were just deciding who should dig the cellar for the new town hall mike mulligan spoke to henry b swap one of the selectmen i heard he said that you are going to build a new town hall mary anne and i will dig the cellar for you in just one day what said henry b swap dig a cellar in a day it would take a hundred men at least a week to dig the cellar for our new town hall sure said mike but mary anne can dig as much in a day as a hundred men can dig in a week though he had never been quite sure that this was true then he added if we can’t do it you won’t have to pay henry b swap thought that this would be an easy way to get part of the cellar dug for nothing so he smiled in rather a mean way and gave the job of digging the cellar of the new town hall to mike mulligan and mary anne they started in early the next morning just as the sun was coming up soon a little boy came along do you think you will finish by sundown he said to mike mulligan sure said mike if you stay and watch us we always work faster and better when someone is watching us so the little boy stayed to watch then mrs mcgillicuddy henry b swap and the town constable came over to see what was happening and they stayed to watch mike mulligan and mary anne dug a little faster and a little better this gave the little boy a good idea he ran off and told the postman with the morning mail the telegraph boy on his bicycle the milkman with his cart and horse the doctor on his way home and the farmer and his family coming into town for the day and they all stopped and stayed to watch that made mike mulligan and mary anne dig a little faster and a little better they finished the first corner neat and square but the sun was getting higher clang clang clang the fire department arrived they had seen the smoke and thought there was a fire then the little boy said why don’t you stay and watch so the fire department of popperville stayed to watch mike mulligan and mary anne when they heard the fire engine the children in the school across the street couldn’t keep their eyes on their lessons the teacher called a long recess and the whole school came out to watch that made mike mulligan and mary anne dig still faster and still better they finished the second corner neat and square but the sun was right up in the top of the sky now the girl who answers the telephone called up the next towns of bangerville and bopperville and kipperville and kopperville and told them what was happening in popperville all the people came over to see if mike mulligan and his steam shovel could dig the cellar in just one day the more people came the faster mike mulligan and mary anne dug but they would have to hurry they were only halfway and the sun was beginning to go down they finished the third corner neat and square never had mike mulligan and mary anne had so many people to watch them never had they dug so fast and so well and never had the sun seemed to go down so fast hurry mike mulligan hurry hurry shouted the little boy there’s not much more time dirt was flying everywhere and the smoke and steam were so thick that the people could hardly see anything but listen bing bang crash slam faster and faster then suddenly it was quiet slowly the dirt settled down the smoke and steam cleared away and there was the cellar all finished four corners neat and square four walls straight down and mike mulligan and mary anne at the bottom and the sun was just going down behind the hill hurray shouted the people hurray for mike mulligan and his steam shovel they have dug the cellar in just one day suddenly the little boy said how are they going to get out that’s right said ms mcgillicuddy to henry b swap how is he going to het his steam shovel out henry b swap didn’t answer but he smiled in rather a mean way then everybody said how are they going to get out hi mike mulligan how are you going to get your steam shovel out mike mulligan looked around at the four square walls and four square corners and he said we’ve dug so fast and we’ve dug so well that we’ve quite forgotten to leave a way out nothing like this had ever happened to mike mulligan and mary anne before and they didn’t know what to do nothing like this had ever happened before in popperville everybody started talking at once and everybody had a different idea and everybody thought that his idea was the best they talked and they talked and they argued and they fought till they were worn out and still no one knew how to get mike mulligan and mary anne out of the cellar they had dug then henry b swap said the job isn’t finished because mary anne isn’t out of the cellar so mike mulligan won’t get paid and he smiled again in a rather mean way now the little boy who had been keeping very quiet had another good idea he said why couldn’t we leave mary anne in the cellar and build the new town hall above her let her be the furnace for the new town hall and let mike mulligan be the janitor then you wouldn’t have to buy a new furnace and we could pay mike mulligan for digging the cellar in just one day why not said henry b swap and smiled in a way that was not quite so mean why not said the town constable why not said all the people so they found a ladder and climbed down into the cellar to ask mike mulligan and mary anne why not said mike mulligan so it was decided and everybody was happy they built the new town hall right over mike mulligan and mary anne it was finished before winter every day the little boy goes over to see mike mulligan and mary anne and mrs mcgillicuddv takes him nice hot apple pies as for henry b swap he spends most of his time in the cellar of the new town hall listening to the stories that mike mulligan has to tell and smiling in a way that isn’t mean at all now when you go to popperville be sure to go down in the cellar of the new town hall there they’ll be mike mulligan and mary anne mike in his rocking chair smoking his pipe and mary anne beside him warming up his meetings in the new town hall in the great forest a little elephant is born his name is babar his mother loves him very much she rocks him to sleep with her trunk while singing softly to him babar has grown bigger he now plays with the other little elephants he is a very good little elephant see him digging in the sand with his shell babar is riding happily on his mother’s back when a wicked hunter hidden behind some bushes shoots at them the hunter has killed babar’s mother the monkey hides the birds fly away babar cries the hunter runs up to catch babar babar runs away because he is afraid of the hunter after several days very tired indeed he comes to a town he hardly knows what to make of it because this is the first time that he has seen so many houses so many things are new to him the broad streets the automobiles and buses however he is especially interested in two gentlemen he notices on the street he says to himself really they are very well dressed i would like to have some fine clothes too i wonder how i can get them luckily a very rich old lady who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit as she likes to make people happy she gives him her purse babar says to her politely thank you madam without wasting any time babar goes into a big store he enters the elevator it is such fun to ride up and down in this funny box that he rides all the way up ten times and all the way down ten times he did not want to stop but the elevator boy finally said to him this is not a toy mr elephant you must get out and do your shopping look here is the floorwalker babar then buys himself a shirt with a collar and a tie a suit of a becoming shade of green then a handsome derby hat and also shoes with spats well satisfied with his purchases and feeling elegant indeed babar now goes to the photographer to have his picture taken and here is his photograph babar dines with his friend the old lady she thinks he looks very smart in his new clothes after dinner because he is tired he goes to bed and falls asleep very quickly babar now lives at the old lady’s house in the mornings he does setting up exercises with her and then takes his bath he goes out for an automobile ride every day the old lady has given him a car she gives him whatever he wants a learned professor gives him lessons babar pays attention and does well in his work he is a good pupil and makes rapid progress in the evening after dinner he tells the old lady’s friends about his life in the great forest however babar is not quite happy for he misses playing in the great forest with his little cousins and his friends the monkeys he often stands at the window thinking sadly of his childhood and cries when he remembers his mother two years have passed one day during his walk he sees two little elephants coming toward him they have no clothes on why he says in astonishment to the old lady it’s arthur and celeste my little cousins babar kisses them affectionately and hurries off with them to buy them some fine clothes he takes them to a pastry shop to eat some good cakes meanwhile in the forest the elephants are searching high and low for arthur and celeste and their mothers are worried fortunately in flying over the town an old marabou bird has seen them and comes back quickly to tell the news the mothers of arthur and celeste have come to the town to fetch them back but they scold them just the same because they ran away babar makes up his mind to go back with arthur and celeste and their mothers to see the great forest again the old lady helps him to pack his trunk they are all ready to start babar kisses the old lady good bye he would be quite happy to go if it were not for leaving her he promises to come back some day he will never forget her they have gone there is no room in the car for the mothers so they run behind and lift up their trunks to avoid breathing the dust the old lady is left alone sadly she wonders when shall i see my little babar again alas that very day the king of the elephants had eaten a bad mushroom it poisoned him and he became ill so ill that he died this was a great calmity after the funeral the oldest elephants were holding a meeting to choose a new king just then they hear a noise they turn around guess what they see babar arriving in his car and all the elephants running and shouting here they are here they are hello babar hello arthur hello celeste what beautiful clothes what a beautiful car then cornelius the oldest of all the elephants spoke in his quavering voice my good friends we are seeking a king why not choose babar he has just returned from the big city he has learned so much among living men let us crown him king all the other elephants thought that cornelius had spoken wisely and eagerly await babar’s reply i want to thank you one and all said babar but before accepting your proposal i must explain to you that while traveling in the car celeste and i became engaged if i become your king she will be your queen long live queen celeste long live king babar cry all the elephants without a moment’s hesitation and thus it was that babar became king you have good ideas said babar to cornelius i will therefore make you a general and when i get my crown i will give you my hat in a week i shall marry celeste we will have a spendid party in honor of our marriage and our coronation then turning to the birds babar asks them to go and invite all the animals to the festivities and he tells the dromedary to go to the town and buy some beautiful wedding clothes the wedding guests begin to arrive the dromedary returns with the bridal costumes just in the nick of time for the ceremony after the wedding and the coronation everybody dances merrily the festivities are over night has fallen the stars have risen in the sky king babar and queen celeste are indeed very happy now the world is asleep the guests have gone home happy though tired from too much dancing they will long remember this great celebration and now king babar and queen celeste both eager for further adventures set out on their honeymoon in a gorgeous yellow balloon the night max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another his mother called his wild thing and max said i’ll eat you up so he was sent to bed without eating anything that night in max’s room a forest grew and grew and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for max and he sailed off through the night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws till max said be still and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all and made him king of all the wild things and now cried max let the wild rumpus start now stop max said and sent all the wild things off to bed without their supper and max king of all the wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all then all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat so he gave up being king of where the wild things are but the wild things cried oh please don’t go we’ll eat you up we love you so and max said no the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but max stepped into his private boat and wave good bye and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still hot once upon a time there were four little rabbits and their names were flopsy mopsy cottontail and peter they lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree now my dears said old mrs rabbit one morning you may go into the fields or down the lane but don’t go into mr mcgregor’s garden your father had an accident there he was put in a pie by mrs mcgregor now run along and don’t get into mischief i am going out then old mrs rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the baker’s she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns flopsy mopsy and cottontail who were good little bunnies went down the lane to gather blackberries but peter who was very naughty ran straight away to mr mcgregor’s garden and squeezed under the gate first he ate some lettuces and some french beans and then he ate some radishes and then feeling rather sick he went to look for some parsley but round the end of a cucumber frame whom should be meet but mr mcgregor mr mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and ran after peter waving a rake and calling out stop thief peter was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to the gate he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages and the other shoe amongst the potatoes after losing them he ran on four legs and went faster so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself mr mcgregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop upon the top of peter but peter wriggled out just in time leaving his jacket behind him and rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it mr mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot he began to turn them over carefully looking under each presently peter sneezed kertyschoo mr mcgregor was after him in no time and tried to put his foot upon peter who jumped out of a window upsetting three plants the window was too small for mr mcgregor and he was tired of running after peter he went back to his work peter sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with fright and he had no the least idea which way to go also he was very damp with sitting in that can after a time began to wander about going lippity lippity not very fast and looking all around he found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer she only shook her head at him peter began to cry then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled presently he came to a pond where mr mcgregor filled his water cans a white cat was staring at some goldfish she sat very very still but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her he had heard about cats from his cousin little benjamin bunny he went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a hoe scr r ritch scratch scratch scritch peter scuttered underneath the bushes but presently as nothing happened he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over the first thing he saw was mr mcgregor hoeing his onions his back was turned towards peter and beyond him was the gate peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go along a straight walk behind some black currant bushes mr mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner but peter did not care he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden mr mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten blackbirds peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir tree he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole and shut his eyes his mother was busy cooking she wondered what he had done with his clothes it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight i’m sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening his mother put him to bed and made some chamomile tea and she gave a dose of it to peter one tablespoonful to be taken at bedtime but flopsy mopsy and cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper the end once upon a time in spain there was a little bull and his name was ferdinand all the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together but not ferdinand he liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers he had a favorite spot out in the pasture under a cork tree it was his favorite tree and he would sit in its shade all day and smell the flowers sometimes his mother who was a cow would worry about him she was afraid he would be lonesome all by himself why don’t you run and play with the other little bulls and skip and butt your head she would say but ferdinand would shake his head i like it better here where i can sit just quietly and smell the flowers his mother saw that he was not lonesome and because she was an understanding mother even though she was a cow she let him just sit there and be happy as the years went by ferdinand grew and grew until he was very big and strong all the other bulls who had grown up with him in the same pasture would fight each other all day they would butt each other and stick each other with their horns what they wanted most of all was to be picked to fight at the bull fights in madrid but not ferdinand he still liked to sit just quietly under the cork tree and smell the flowers one day five men came in very funny hats to pick the biggest fastest roughest bull to fight in the bull fights in madrid all the other bulls ran around snorting and butting leaping and jumping so the men would think that they were very very strong and fierce and pick them ferdinand knew that they wouldn’t pick him and he didn’t care so he went out to his favorite cork tree to sit down he didn’t look where he was sitting and instead of sitting on the nice cool grass in the shade he sat on a bumble bee well if you were a bumble bee and a bull sat on you what would you do you would sting him and that is just what this bee did to ferdinand wow did it hurt ferdinand jumped up with a snort he ran around puffing and snorting butting and pawing the ground as if he were crazy the five men saw him and they all shouted with joy here was the largest and fiercest bull of all just the one for the bull fights in madrid so they rook him away for the bull fight day in a cart what a day it was flags were flying bands were playing and all the lovely ladies had flowers in their hair they had a parade into the bull ring first came the banderilleros with long sharp pins with ribbons on them to stick in the bull and make him mad next came the picadores who rode skinny horses and they had long spears to stick in the bull and make him madder then came the matador the proudest of all he thought he was very handsome and bowed to the ladies he had a red cape and a sword and was supposed to stick the bull last of all then came the bull and you know who that was don’t you ferdinand they called him ferdinand the fierce and all the banderilleros were afraid of him and the picadores were afraid of him and the matador was scared stiff ferdinand ran to the middle of the ring and everyone shouted and clapped because they thought he was going to fight fiercely and butt and snort and stick his horns around but not ferdinand when he got to the middle of the ring he saw the flowers in all the lovely ladies hair and he just sat down quietly and smelled he wouldn’t fight and be fierce no matter what they did he just sat and smelled and the banderilleros were mad and the picadores were madder and the matador was so mad he cried because he couldn’t show off with his cape and sword so they had to take ferdinand home and for all i know he is sitting there still under his favorite cork tree smelling the flowers just quietly he is very happy the end a mother bird sat on her egg the egg jumped oh oh said the mother bird my baby will be here he will want to eat i must get something for my baby bird to eat she said i will be back so away she went the egg jumped it jumped and jumped and jumped out came the baby bird where is my mother he said he looked for her he looked up he did not see her he looked down he did not see her i will go and look

she was born was the happiest day in her parents lives she’s perfect said her mother absolutely said her father and she was she was absolutely perfect her name must be everything she is said her mother her name must be absolutely perfect said her father and it was chrysanthemum her parents named her chrysanthemum chrysanthemum grew and grew and grew and when she was old enough to appreciate it chrysanthemum loved her name she loved the way it sounded when her mother woke her up she loved the way it sounded when her father called her for dinner and she loved the way it sounded when she whispered it to herself in the bathroom mirror chrysanthemum chrysanthemum chrysanthemum chrysanthemum loved the way her name looked when it was written with ink on an envelope she loved the way it looked when it was written with icing on her birthday cake and she loved the way it looked when she wrote it herself with her fat orange crayon chrysanthemum chrysanthemum chrysanthemum chrysanthemum thought her name was absolutely perfect and then she started school on the first day chrysanthemum wore her sunniest dress and her brightest smile she ran all the way hooray said chrysanthemum school but when mrs chud took roll call everyone giggled upon hearing chrysanthemum’s name it’s so long said jo it scarcely fits on your name tag said rita pointing i’m named after my grandmother said victoria you’re named after a flower chrysanthemum wilted she did not think her name was absolutely perfect she thought it was absolutely dreadful the rest of the day was not much better during naptime victoria raised her hand and informed mrs chud that chrysanthemum’s name was spelled with thirteen letters that’s exactly half as many letters as there are in the entire alphabet victoria explained thank you for sharing that with us victoria said mrs chud now put your head down if i had a name like yours i’d change it victoria said as the students lined up to go home i wish i could thought chrysanthemum miserably welcome home said her mother welcome home said her father school is no place for me said chrysanthemum my name is too long it scarcely fits on my name tag and i’m named after a flower oh pish said her mother your name is beautiful and her precious and priceless and fascinating and winsome said her father it’s everything you are said her mother absolutely perfect said her father chrysanthemum felt much better after her favorite dinner macaroni and cheese with ketchup and an evening filled with hugs and kisses and parcheesi that night chrysanthemum dreamed that her name was jane it was an extremely pleasant dream the next morning chrysanthemum wore her most comfortable jumper she walked to school as slowly as she could she dragged her feet in the dirt chrysanthemum chrysanthemum chrysanthemum she wrote she even looks like a flower said victoria as chrysanthemum entered the playground let’s pick her said rita pointing let’s smell her said jo chrysanthemum wilted she did not think her name was absolutely perfect she thought it was absolutely dreadful the rest of the day was not much better during naptime victoria raised her hand and said a chrysanthemum is a flower it lives in a garden with worms and other dirty things thank you for sharing that with us victoria said mrs chud now put your head down i just cannot believe your name victoria said as the students lined up to go home neither can i thought chrysanthemum miserably welcome home said her mother welcome home said her father school is no place for me said chrysanthemum

wouldn’t be jealous of a name like yours said her mother after all it’s absolutely perfect said her father chrysanthemum felt a trifle better after her favorite dessert chocolate cake with buttercream frosting and another evening filled with hugs and kisses and parcheesi that night chrysanthemum dreamed that she really was a chrysanthemum she sprouted leaves and petals victoria picked her and plucked the leaves and petals one by one until there was nothing left but a scrawny stem it was the worst nightmare of chrysanthemum’s life chrysanthemum wore her outfit with seven pockets the next morning she loaded the pockets with her most prized possessions and her good luck charms chrysanthemum took the longest route possible to school she stopped and stared at each and every flower chrysanthemum chrysanthemum chrysanthemum the flowers seemed to say that morning the students were introduced to mrs twinkle the music teacher her voice was like something out of a dream as was everything else about her the students were speechless they thought mrs twinkle was an indescribable wonder they went out of their way to make a nice impression mrs twinkle led the students in scales then she assigned roles for the class musicale victoria was chosen as the dainty fairy queen rita was chosen as the spiffy butterfly princess jo was chosen as the all important pixie messenger and chrysanthemum was chosen as a daisy chrysanthemum’s a daisy chrysanthemum’s a daisy jo rita and victoria chanted thinking it was wildly funny chrysanthemum wilted she did not think her name was absolutely perfect she thought it was absolutely dreadful what’s so humorous asked mrs twinkle chrysanthemum was the answer her name is so long said jo it scarcely fits on her name tag said rita pointing i’m named after my grandmother said victoria she’s named after a flower my name is long said mrs twinkle it is said jo my name would scarcely fit on a name tag said mrs twinkle lt would said rita pointing and said mrs twinkle l’m named after a flower too you are said victoria yes said mrs twinkle my name is delphinium delphinium twinkle and if my baby is a girl i’m considering

hey kid did you know that dragons love tacos they love beef tacos and chicken tacos they love really big gigantic tacos and tiny little baby tacos as well why do dragons loves tacos maybe it’s the smell from the sizzling pan maybe it’s the crunch of the crispy tortillas maybe it’s a secret either way if you want to make friends with dragons tacos are key hey dragon why do you guys love tacos so much but wait as much as dragons love tacos they hate spicy salsa even more they hate spicy green salsa and spicy red salsa they hate spicy chunky salsa and spicy smooth salsa if the salsa is spicy at all dragons can’t stand it why do dragons hate spicy salsa well just one drop of hot sauce makes a dragon’s ears smoke just one single speck of hot pepper makes a dragon snort spark spicy salsa gives dragons the tummy troubles and when dragons get the tummy troubles oh boy if you want to make tacos for dragons keep the toppings mild tomatoes lettuce cheese these are all good toppings for tacos for dragons hey dragon how do you feel about spicy taco toppings dragons love parties they like costume parties and pool parties they like big gigantic parties with accordions and tiny little parties with charades why do dragons love parties maybe it’s the conversation maybe it’s the dancing maybe it’s the comforting sound of a good friend’s laughter the only thing dragons love more than parties or tacos is taco parties taco parties are parties with lots of tacos if you want to have some dragons over for a taco party you’ll need buckets of tacos pantloads of tacos the best way to judge is to get a boat and fill the boat with tacos that’s about how many tacos dragons need for a taco party after all dragons love tacos hey dragon are you excited for the big taco party just remember dragons hate spicy salsa before you host your taco party with dragons get rid of all the spicy salsa in fact bury the spicy salsa in the backyard so the dragons can’t find it these dragons love your taco party they love the music they love the decorations they especially love the tacos congratulations it’s a good thing you got rid of all that spicy wait a second what are those little green things in the salsa you didn’t read the fine print dragons listen to me do not eat those tacos those little green specs in the salsa those are jalapeno peppers they are super spicy i know you love tacos dragons but you are not gonna love those tacos do not let those dragons eat those tacos crunch crunch crunch too late why would dragons help you rebuild your house maybe they’re good samaritans maybe they feel bad for wrecking it maybe they’re just in it for the taco breaks after all dragons love tacos horn went beep engine purred friendliest sounds you ever heard little blue truck rolled into the city beep

trucks were all in a tangle everyone started to shout and wrangle up roared a taxi screech went the brakes stop yelled blue for goodness sakes you might be fast and i might be slow but one at a time

watching gave a shout when the door swung open and the mayor stepped out his honor climbed right up on blue and gave a speech the way mayors do my friends he said what wonderful luck this good advice from a little blue truck one at a time is what we’ll do so single file folks follow blue trucks and buses got in line with vans and taxis and it all went fine a taxi let a van go past the double decker bus said i’ll go last a marching band joined the big parade boom went the drums and the trumpets played they rolled along the avenue and everyone waved to little blue they clapped their hands and yelled hooray for the little blue truck who led the way if you give a mouse a cookie he’s going to ask for a glass of milk when you give him the milk he’ll probably ask you for a straw when he’s finished he’ll ask for a napkin then he’ll want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn’t have a milk mustache when he looks into the mirror he might notice his hair needs a trim so he’ll probably ask for a pair of nail scissors when he’s finished giving himself a trim he’ll want a broom to sweep up he’ll start sweeping he might get carried away and sweep every room in the house he may even end up washing the floors as well when he’s done he’ll probably want to take a nap you’ll have to fix up a little box for him with a blanket and a pillow he’ll crawl in make himself comfortable and fluff the pillow a few times he’ll probably ask you to read him a story so you’ll read to him from one of your books and he’ll ask to see the pictures when he looks at the pictures he’ll get so excited he’ll want to draw one of his own he’ll ask for paper and crayons he’ll draw a picture when the picture is finished he’ll want to sign his name with a pen then he’ll want to hang his picture on your refrigerator which means he’ll need scotch tape he’ll hang up his drawing and stand back to look at it looking at the refrigerator will remind him that he’s thirsty so he’ll ask for a glass of milk and chances are if he asks for a glass of milk he’s going to want a cookie to go with it congratulations today is your day you’re off to great places you’re off and away you have brains in your head you have feet in your shoes you can steer yourself any direction you choose you’re on your own and you know what you know and you are the guy who’ll decide where to go you’ll look up and down streets look em over with care about some you will say i don’t choose to go there with your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet you’re too smart to go down any not so good street and you may not find any you’ll want to go down in that case of course you’ll head straight out of town it’s opener there in the wide open air out there things can happen and frequently do to people as brainy and footsy as you and when things start to happen don’t worry don’t stew just go right along you’ll start happening too oh the places you’ll go you’ll be on your way up you’ll be seeing great sights you’ll join the high fliers who soar to high heights you won’t lag behind because you’ll have the speed you’ll pass the whole gang and you’ll soon take the lead wherever you fly you’ll be best of the best wherever you go you will top all the rest except when you don’t because sometimes you won’t i’m sorry to say so but sadly it’s true that bang ups and hang ups can happen to you you can get all hung up in a prickle ly perch and your gang will fly on you’ll be left in a lurch you’ll come down from the lurch with an unpleasant bump and the chances are then that you’ll be in slump and when you’re in a slump you’re not in for much fun un slumping yourself is not easily done you will come to a place where the streets are not marked some windows are lighted bur mostly they’re darked a place you could sprain both your elbow and chin do you dare to stay out do you dare to go in how much can you lose how much can you win and if you go in should you turn left or right or right and three quarters or maybe not quite or go around back and sneak in from behind simple it’s not i’m afraid you will find for a mind maker upper to make up his mind you can get so confused that you’ll start in to race down long wiggled roads at a break necking pace and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space headed i fear toward a most useless place the waiting place for people just waiting waiting for a train to go or a bus to come or a plane to go or the mail to come or the rain to go or the phone to ring or the snow to snow or waiting around for a yes or no or waiting for their hair to grow everyone is just waiting waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite or waiting around for friday night or waiting perhaps for their uncle jake or a pot to boil or a better break or a string of pearls or a pair of pants or a wig with curls or another chance everyone is just waiting no that s not for you somehow you’ll escape all that waiting and staying you’ll find the bright places where boom bands are playing with banner flip flapping once more you’ll ride high ready for anything under the sky ready because you’re that kind of a guy oh the places you’ll go there is fun to be done there are points to be scored there are games to be won and the magical things you can do with that ball will make you the winning est winner of all fame you’ll be famous as famous can be with the whole wide world watching you win on tv except when they don’t because sometimes they won’t i’m afraid that some times you’ll play lonely games too games you can’t win cause you’ll play against you all alone whether you like it or not alone will be something you’ll be quite a lot and when you’re alone there’s a very good chance you’ll meet things that scare you right out of your pants there are some down the road between hither and yon that can scare you so much you won’t want to go on but on you will go though the weather be foul on you will go though your enemies prowl on you will go though the hakken kraks howl onward up many a frightening creek though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak on and on you will hike and i know you’ll hike far and face up to your problems whatever they are you’ll get mixed up of course as you already know you’ll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go so be sure when you step step with care and great tact and remember that life’s a great balancing act just never forget to be dexterous and deft and never mix up your right foot with your left and will you succeed yes you will indeed 98 and percent guaranteed

thank you sam i am this is george he lived in the zoo he was a good little monkey and always very curious he wanted to find out what was going on outside the zoo one day when the keeper was not paying attention george got hold of the key for the cage when the keeper discovered what had happened it was too late george was gone where was george they looked for him everywhere but they could not find him george was hiding in the hay of his friend the elephant finally the keepers gave up looking for him george found a nice cozy spot to sleep under the elephant’s right ear and the next morning before the zoo opened he got away safely once on the street george felt a little scared what should he do in the big city maybe he could find his friend the man with the yellow hat who had brought him over from africa a long time ago only george did not know where he lived there was a bus stopping at the corner george had never ridden on one quickly he climbed a lamp post jumped on top of the bus and off they went now they were right at the center of the town there was so much to see that george did not know where to look first if only he could go on riding this forever but after a while george got tired and a little dizzy when the bus slowed down to turn into a side street george jumped off there was a restaurant right in front of him mmmm something smelled good suddenly george felt very hungry the kitchen door stood open and george walked in on the table was a big pot of course george was curious he had to find out what was in it when the cook came back he had a big surprise spaghetti was all over the place and in the middle of it was a little monkey george had been eating yards and yards and had wound himself all up in it the cook was a kind man and did not scold much but george had to clean up the kitchen and then do all the dishes my what a lot of them there were the cook was watching george you are lucky to have four hands he said you can do things twice as quickly i have a friend who could use a handy little fellow like you to wash windows if you would like to i will take you over to him so they went down into the subway and took an uptown train to the cook’s friend who was an elevator man in a skyscraper sure i cam use you the elevator man said to george i will give you what you need for the job you can start right away but remember you are here for washing windows never mind what people inside the house are doing don’t be curious or you’ll get into trouble george promised to be good but little monkeys sometimes forget george was ready to start my how many windows there were but george got ahead quickly since he worked with all four hands he jumped from window to window just as he had jumped from tree to tree in the african jungle for a while george stuck to his work and did not pay any attention to the people inside of course he was curious but he remembered his promise in one room a little boy was crying because he did not want to eat his spinach george did not even look but went on with his work in another room a man was taking a nap and snoring george was sorry it was not his friend the man with the yellow hat he listened to the funny noise for a while then went on working but what was going on here george stopped working and pressed his nose against the window two painters were working inside george was fascinated painting looked like a lot more fun than washing windows the painters were ready to go out for lunch the minute they left george climbed inside what wonderful paints and brushes they had george could not resist an hour later the painters came back they opened the door and stood with their mouths wide open the whole room had changed to a jungle with palm trees all over the walls and a giraffe and two leopards and a zebra and a little monkey was busy painting himself on one of the trees then the painters knew what had happened luckily george was close to a door he ran out as fast as he could after him ran the two painters then the elevator man and then the woman who lived in the place oh my lovely room my lovely room cried the woman don’t let him her away george headed for the fire escape george reached the end of the fire escape the others had not caught up with him yet here was his chance they could not jump but george could easily jump down and escape in a moment he would be safe poor little george he had forgotten that the pavement was hard as stone not like the soft grass of the jungle too bad the fall broke his leg and an ambulance came to take george to the hospital he got what he deserved said the woman making my apartment into a jungle indeed i told him he would get into trouble the elevator man added he was too curious george had to lie in bed with his leg high up in a plaster cast he was very unhappy and it had all started out so nicely if only he had not been so curious he could have had a lot of fun now it was too late but the next morning george’s friend the man with the big yellow hat was buying a newspaper suddenly he got very excited this is george he shouted when he saw the picture on the front page quickly he read the whole story and then ran to a telephone booth to ring a hospital i am george’s friend he said to the nurse who answered the telephone please take good care of him so that he will get better quickly i want to take him to a movie studio and make a picture about his life in the jungle don’t let him get into any more mischief until i can take him away finally the day came when george could walk again your friend is going to take you away this morning said the nurse just wait right here for him and don’t touch anything as soon as george was alone he looked around at the strange hospital things i wonder what is in that big blue bottle he thought and this is how the man with the yellow hat found george when he came to call for him they picked him up and shook him but they could not wake him up he was so fast asleep that finally they had to put him under the shower how surprised his was when he woke up george said goodbye to the nurse and the kind doctor then he and the man with the yellow hat got into the car to drive to the movie studio in the president’s office george had to sign a contract now he was a movie actor in the studio george was kept so busy all the time that he forgot to be curious he liked the jungle they made for him and played happily there and when the movie was finally finished george invited all his friends to see it the doctor and the nurse and the ambulance driver and the man from the newstand and the woman and the elevator man and the two painters and the cook and the reporter and all the keepers of the zoo now the lights went out and the picture started this is george the voice began he lived in the jungle he was a good little monkey he had only one fault he was too curious the end ooooo a hot dog yummy yummy yummy aaaaaahhh may i help you is that a hot dog not a hot

slowly and he wobbled a lot but it was fun duck rode past cow and waved to her hello cow said duck m o o o said cow but what she thought was a duck on a bike that’s the silliest thing i’ve ever seen then duck rode past sheep hello sheep said duck b a a a said sheep but what she thought was he’s going to hurt himself if he’s not careful duck was riding better now he rode past dog hello dog said

pedaled a little faster he rode past horse hello horse said duck ne e e igh said horse but what he though was you’re still not as fast as me duck duck rang his bell as he rode toward chicken hello

didn’t see duck they parked their bikes by the house and went inside now all the animals had bikes they rode around and around the barnyard this is fun they all said good idea duck then they put the bikes back by the house and no one knew that on that afternoon there had been a cow a sheep a dog a cat a horse a chicken a goat two pigs a mouse and a duck on a bike the end harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything except getting a bath so one day when he heard the water running in the tub he took the scrubbing brush and buried it in the backyard then he ran away from home he played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty he played at the railroad and got even dirtier he played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still he slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all in fact he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots although there were many other things to do harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away he felt tired and hungry too so without stopping on the way he ran back home when harry got to his house he crawled through the fence and sat looking at the back door one of the family looked out and said there’s a strange dog in the backyard by the way has anyone seen harry when harry heard this he tired very hard to show them he was harry he started to do all his old clever tricks he flip flopped and he flop flipped he rolled over and played dead he danced and he sang he did these tricks over and over again but everyone shook their heads and said oh no it couldn’t be harry harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate but suddenly he stopped he ran to a corner of the garden and started to dog furiously soon he jumped away from the hole barking short happy barks he’s found the scrubbing brush and carrying it in his mouth he ran into the house he jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging with the scrubbing brush in his mouth a trick he certainly had never done before this little doggie wants a bath cried the little girl and her father said why don’t you and your brother give him one harry’s bath was the soapiest one he’d ever had it worked like magic as soon as the children started to scrub they began shouting mummy daddy look look come quick it’s harry it’s harry it’s harry they cried harry wagged his tail and was very very happy his family combed and brushed him lovingly and he became once again a white dog with black spots it was wonderful to be home after dinner harry fell asleep in his favorite place happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty he slept so soundly he didn’t even feel the scrubbing brush he’d hidden under his pillow how does a dinosaur say good night when papa comes in to turn off the light does a

happy she had gone shopping with her grammy over the weekend lilly had a new pair of movie star sunglasses complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like mr slinger’s she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened lilly wanted to show everyone not now said mr slinger listen to our story lilly had a hard time listening lilly really wanted to show everyone not now said mr slinger let’s be considerate of our classmates lilly had a hard time being considerate lilly really really wanted to show everyone not

mention how excellent it was for storing school supplies look lilly whispered fiercely look everyone look what i’ve got everyone looked including mr slinger he was not amused i’ll just keep your things at my desk until the end of the day said mr slinger they’ll be safe there and then you can take them home lilly’s stomach lurched she felt like crying her glasses were gone her quarters wert gone her purple plastic purse was gone lilly longed for her purse all morning she was even too sad to eat the snack mr slinger served before recess that afternoon lilly went to the lightbulb lab she was still very sad she thought and she thought and she thought and then she became angry she thought and she thought and she thought some more and then she became furious she thought and she thought and she thought a bit longer and then she drew a picture of mr slinger big fat mean mr stealing teacher bad claws thief bad wanted by f.b.i p.s i do not want to be a teacher when i grow up right before the last bell rang lilly sneaked the drawing into mr slinger’s book bag when all the students were buttoned and zipped and snapped and tied and ready to go home mr slinger strolled over to lilly and gave her purple plastic purse back it’s a beautiful purse said mr slinger your quarters are nice and jingly and those glasses are absolutely fabulous you may bring them back to school as long as you don’t disturb the rest of the class i do not want to be a teacher when i grow up lilly said as she marched out of the classroom on the way home lilly opened her purse her glasses and quarters were inside and so was a note from mr slinger it said today was a difficult day tomorrow will be better there was also a small bag of tasty snacks at the bottom of the purse lilly’s stomach lurched she felt like crying she felt simply awful lilly ran all the way home and told her mother and father everything instead of watching her favorite cartoons lilly decided to sit in the uncooperative chair i’ll stay here a million years for mr slinger why does everything always happen to me one thousand fifty one one thousand fifty two one thousand ninety nine that night lilly drew a new picture of mr slinger and wrote a story about him too lilly was really really sorry so everyone forgave her even her parents even her stinky baby brother even her especially incredible teacher and

glamorous protection from harmful rays during sharing time lilly demonstrated the many uses and unique qualities of her purple plastic purse her shiny quarters and her glittery movie star sunglasses then she did a little performance using them as props it’s called interpretive dance said lilly mr slinger joined in wow said the entire crass that was just about all they could say wow throughout the

manners the bear family’s trouble with manners was that they forgot them at first it was just an occasional please or thank you that was forgotten then there was a rude push without an excuse me then a reach across the table instead of a please pass the broccoli mama bear wasn’t quite sure how or why it happened but she was sure of one thing whatever the reason the bear family had become a pushing shoving name calling ill mannered mess sillyhead fuzzbrain noodlepuss at the table it was even worse they were a grabbing mouth stuffing food fighting kicking under the table super mess of course mama bear tried to correct brother and sister bear’s behavior she tried coaxing she tried complaining she tried shouting she tried going to papa for help though it sometimes seemed to mama that he was part of the problem papa banged on the table and shouted as only he could shout but nothing really seemed to do any good mama didn’t like what was happening to her family not one bit something had to be done but what the best way to fight bad habits she thought was with good habits then she thought of a plan she got a big piece of cardboard and a marker at the top she wrote the bear eamily politeness plan when the plan was finished she called a family meeting and showed it to papa and the cubs it certainly got the bear family’s attention the bear family politeness plan rudeness penalty forgetting please or thank you sweep front steps pushing or shoving beat two rugs interrupting dust downstairs name calling clean cellar reaching at table clean yard playing with food wash dishes rude noises weed garden banging door clean attic forgetting excuse me empty garbage hogging bathroom put out trash mama’s plan had a list of all the rude things she wanted to stop beside each one was a penalty a job or chore that went with it if you forgot a please or a thank you you had to sweep the front steps if you pushed or shoved you had to beat two rugs if you got caught name calling you had to clean the whole cellar but mama sputtered the cubs you’re not being fair it seems to me she said that you’re the ones who aren’t being fair to yourselves or anyone else that’s what manners are all about being fair and considerate manners are very important they help us get along with each other why without manners your mama’s absolutely right interrupted papa thank you papa for your comment but interrupting is number three on the rude list and the penalty is dusting the downstairs mama said and handed him the feather duster hmm said brother this looks serious i think we’d better come up with a plan of our own or we’re going to be doing a lot of extra chores what sort of plan asked sister well he said instead of just being polite we’ll be super polite we’ll please and thank you so much that mama will get fed up and call the whole thing off yes said sister we’ll be so polite she won’t be able to stand it they put their plan into action they were super polite on the stairs after you sister dear thank you dear brother in the hall excuse me brother dear why certainly my dear sister waiting for the bathroom terribly sorry to have kept you waiting think nothing of it my dear but it didn’t work the way they expected mama didn’t get fed up at all and after a while brother and sister forgot about being super polite and were just polite at the table pass the honey please certainly in their room would you like me to help you pick up your toys thank you very much in the yard oops sorry i didn’t mean to bump you that’s all right no harm done and it turned out that mama had been right things did go more smoothly once they got into the good manners habit they didn’t even have to think about it but it wasn’t so easy for papa he was the one who got fed up it’s a little harder to change habits when you’re older and he had to do quite a few extra chores for forgetting his manners i’m glad to get out of the house away from that politeness plan he said as he drove the family along the highway on a trip to the supermarket manners and courtesy are just as important away from home especially on the road said mama as they stopped at a stop sign to let pedestrians and other cars pass they help us drive safely well grumbled papa as they all went into the busy supermarket i think you can have too much of a good thing you’ve got to have common sense along with manners why if you let everyone go ahead of you at the checkout you’d be there forever and sometimes you have to interrupt excuse me mad am he interrupted a shopper but i believe you have a leaking bottle in your cart the shopper thanked him for his help you see he said driving home there’s more to life than remembering your manners besides manners are all right for cubs and mama bears but we papa bears have other things to think about at that moment the car in front stopped suddenly and papa bumped into it he was furious why that pinheaded fiddlebrain he snarled name calling reminded sister the penalty for name calling was cleaning the whole cellar so papa gritted his teeth and remembered his manners and a good thing too because climbing out of the other car was the biggest angriest bear he had ever seen but when the angry bear saw how polite papa was he remembered his manners too he explained that he had stopped short because a mama duck and her ducklings had crossed in front of him then he and papa bear looked at their bumpers and saw that no harm had been done as i was saying said papa as they continued on their way it’s very important for us to remember our manners at all times and i want to thank you sister for reminding me to remember mine you’re very welcome i’m sure said sister bear politely this hat is not mine i just stole it i stole it from a big fish he was asleep when i did it and he probably won’t wake up for along time and even if he does wake up he probably won’t notice that it’s gone and even if he does notice that it’s gone he probably won’t know it was me who took it and even if he does guess it was me he won’t know where i am going but i will tell you where i am going i am going where the plants grow big and tall and close together it is very hard to see in there nobody will ever find me there is someone who saw me already but he said he wouldn’t tell anyone which way i went so i am not worried about that i know it’s wrong to steal a hat i know it does not belong to me but i am going to keep it it was too small for him anyway it fits me just right and look i made it there the plants are big and tall and close together i knew i was going to make it nobody will ever find me there used to be an alligator under my bed when it was time to go to sleep i had to be very careful because i knew he was there but whenever i looked he hid or something so i’d call mom and dad but they never saw it it was up to me i just had to do something about that alligator so i went to the kitchen to get some alligator bait i filled a paper bag full of things alligators like to eat i put a peanut butter sandwich some fruit and the last piece of pie in the garage i put cookies down the hall i left fresh vegetables on the stairs i put a soda and some candy next to my bed then i watched and waited sure enough out he came to get something to eat then i hid in the hall closet i followed him down the stairs i followed him down the hall when he crawled into the garage i slammed the door and locked it then i went to bed there wasn’t even any mess to clean up now that there is an alligator in the garage i wonder if my dad will have any trouble getting in his car tomorrow morning i’ll just leave him a note in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf one sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar he started to look for some food on monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry on saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one ice cream cone one pickle one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon that night he had a stomachache the next day was sunday again the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better now he wasn’t hungry anymore and he wasn’t a little caterpillar any more he was a big fat caterpillar he built a small house called a cocoon around himself he stayed inside for more than two weeks then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and he was a beautiful butterfly not so long ago before she could even speak words trixie went on an errand with her daddy trixie and her daddy went down the block through the park past the school and into the laundromat trixie helped her daddy put the laundry into the machine she even got to put the money into the machine then they left but a block or so later trixie realized something trixie turned to her daddy and said aggle flaggle klabble that’s right replied her daddy we’re going home aggle flaggle klabble said trixie again blaggle plaggle wumby flappy snurp now please don’t get fussy said her daddy well she had no choice she went boneless she did everything she could to show how unhappy she was by the time they got home her daddy was unhappy too as soon as trixie’s mommy opened the door she asked where’s knuffle bunny the whole family ran down the block and they ran through the park they zoomed past the school and into the laundromat trixie’s daddy looked for knuffle bunny and looked and looked and looked but knuffle bunny was nowhere to be found so trixie’s daddy decided to look harder until knuffle bunny and those were the first words trixie ever said we’re finally here declares lulu as she jumps out of the car and spreads her wings i love the beach says lulu you’ve never even been to the beach before replied her big brother but i already know that i love it she says and i can’t wait to go swimming in the waves the sand feels warm under her feet as lulu and bingo lead the family to a good spot to spread their blanket lulu runs to the edge of the water the ocean goes on and on and makes huge roaring sounds she had no idea it was going to be so big and noisy she takes a few steps backward bingo barks at the waves are you going in he brother yells running past her and splashing into the water i don’t think so she says um i really came here to build sand castles lulu retreats to the beach blanket to find her trusty pail and shovel she builds a giant sand castle and uses little sticks for people the king and the queen are very happy here she thinks bingo digs a moat to keep them extra safe lulu walks over and sits down next to her mama she looks out at the ocean which is glittering with light she thinks it looks pretty from far away do you want to go into the water asks mama no lulu says i want to fly the kite now soon the kite is darting back and forth in the wind but lulu holds on tight after the wind dies down it feels really hot lulu glances at the ocean she thinks the water would be cool but the waves still look much too big this is a good time to remind her parents about ice cream lulu lists all her top eleven favorite flavors chocolate marshmallow cherry vanilla pistachio butter pecan peppermint bon bon peanut butter chip raspberry swirl peach pie almond fudge royal banana surprise and vanilla at the ice cream stand lulu can’t just choose one this is a day for a double scoop her mama says sometimes mamas can be very right come on bingo says lulu after she finishes her ice cream let’s take a walk down the beach they find a long piece of driftwood lulu writes loopy l’s in the sand and draws pictures of bingo he’s the perfect subject and stays really still it is very hot lulu looks at the ocean other kids are splashing and jumping in the waves she walks down to the edge of the water should we get out feet wet bingo she asks she thinks it would be okay to go into the ocean just a little bit suddenly a wave crashes into her legs and nearly knocks her over just as she gets her balance the whirling water races back and tries to pull her in her feet get buried in the sand up to her ankles are you okay bingo lulu asks she looks around to see if anyone notices that they were almost carried away but everyone is playing just as they were before let’s be explorers says lulu brushing the sand off her knees we can collect things for our museum they march off across the beach they hear seagulls that sound like they are laughing discover little crabs that burrow into the sand ad pick up slimy seaweed washed up on the shore there are also lots of shells on the beach all different shapes and sizes she chooses the most special one and puts them into her pail i know bingo i bet if we dig we could find a pirate treasure says lulu she digs and digs and digs finding treasure is hard work when lulu feels the water splash against her she spins around the tide has come in it is taking away her favorite pail she has to rescue it or it will be lost forever this is a job for ladybug girl i’ll save you she says snapping up the pail when she looks down she realizes she is in the ocean she is actually in the ocean the water is past her knees and she isn’t afraid at all ladybug girl isn’t afraid of anything for the rest of the long afternoon ladybug girl and bingo splash in the water and run on the beach daring the waves to catch them you can’t get me waves i’m ladybug girl ladybug girl and bingo play until the bright blue sky turns pink they make footprints in the sand at least 14 miles of them ladybug girl thinks every time the ocean erases them they make more then it is time to go and ladybug girl trudges back across the still warm sand bingo follows slowly dragging his ears standing at the top of the dunes ladybug girl waits for her brother so did you like your first time at the beach he asks yes she answers i told you ladybug girl loves the beach amos mcgee was an early riser every morning when the alarm clock clanged he swung his legs out of bed and swapped his pajamas for a fresh pressed uniform he would wind his watch and set a pot of water to boil saying to the sugar bowl a spoonful for my oatmeal please and two for my teacup belly full and ready for the workday he’d amble out the door every day amos waited for the number five bus next stop city zoo the bus driver would call 6 a.m right on time he’d reply amos had a lot to do at the zoo but he always made time to visit his good friends he would play chess with the elephant who thought and thought before making a move run races with the tortoise who never ever lost sit quietly with the penguin who was very shy lend a handkerchief to the rhinoceros who always had a runny nose and at sunset read stories to the owl who was afraid of the dark one day amos awoke with the sniffles and the sneezes and the chills he swung his achy legs out of bed curled them back again and said ugh i don’t think i’ll be going to work today meanwhile at the zoo the animals waited for their friend the elephant arranged his pawns and polished his castles the tortoise stretched his legs and limbered up the penguin sat patiently all by himself the rhinoceros worried that his allergies were worsening the owl perched atop a tall stack of storybooks scratching his head with concern where is amos the animals wondered later that day hooray my good friends are here the elephant prepared a game of chess amos thought and thought before making a move i’m too tired to run races today said amos to the tortoise let’s play hide and seek instead the tortoise hid inside his shell amos hid beneath the covers amos yawned i could use a nap the penguin sat

the circus was in town a smaller sign said the circus needed help we always wanted to join a circus we ran there as fast as clifford could run the owner said everything was going wrong he didn’t think they could put on the show i told him clifford and i would help him he didn’t think a girl and her dog could be much help but i said the show must go on the first problem was the lions and tigers they wouldn’t obey the animal trainer clifford gave them a command they listened to clifford after that the animal trainer didn’t have to worry anymore some clowns had quit the circus the other clowns needed help with their act i was sure clifford could help clifford tried on some costumes he found one he liked and joined the act clifford enjoyed being a clown he wagged his tail that made the act even better the tightrope walker had a sprained ankle clifford tried to walk the tightrope he was pretty good it wasn’t his fault that he couldn’t get off the ground before the next act we walked out on the midway clifford loves cotton candy he sniffed it he sniffed a little too hard licking the cotton candy off his nose made him thirsty he took a drink the circus man tried to stop him it was too late clifford had spoiled the high diver’s act but he didn’t spoil the high diver whew that was close the second half of the circus began with the elephants on parade the biggest elephant had a cold in its nose and couldn’t lead the parade so clifford slipped into an elephant suit and gave them a hand i mean a tail the next act was the human cannon ball she didn’t have any gunpowder for her cannon so clifford helped her out he helped her right out of the tent then came the grand finale i was going up in a balloon with the circus man everyone came out to watch oh dear the rope broke i didn’t worry i knew clifford would save us he rushed to the rescue but he missed the rope we were blowing away things looked bad clifford didn’t give up he grabbed an extra tent pole he used some telephone wire and took aim bull’s eye the balloon was falling like a rock we were scared silly but clifford got there in time good old clifford everybody said it was the most exciting end a circus ever had clifford saved the show and me the sun did not shine it was too wet to play so we sat in the house all that cold cold wet day i sat there with sally we sat there we two and i said how i wish we had something to do too wet to go out and too cold to play ball so we sat in the house we did nothing at all so all we could do was to sit sit sit sit and we did not like it not one little bit and

soon all the aphids were gone thank you said the leaf you are welcome answered both ladybugs and they went to sleep the fireflies who had been sleeping all day came out to dance around the moon everybody knows the story of the three little pigs or at least they think they do but i’ll let you in on a little secret nobody knows the real story because nobody has ever heard my side of the story i’m the wolf alexander t wolf you can call me al i don’t know how this whole big bad wolf thing got started but it’s all wrong maybe it’s because of our diet hey it’s not my fault wolves eat cute little animals like bunnies and sheep and pigs that’s just the way we are if cheeseburgers were cute folks would probably think you were big and bad too but like i was saying the whole big bad wolf thing is all wrong the real story is about a sneeze and a cup of sugar way back in once upon a time time i was making a birthday cake for my dear old granny i had a terrible sneezing cold i ran out of sugar so i walked down the street to ask my neighbor for a cup of sugar now this neighbor was a pig and he wasn’t too bright either he had built his whole house out of straw can you believe it i mean who in his right mind would build a house of straw so of course the minute i knocked on the door it fell right in i didn’t want to just walk into someone else’s house so i called little pig little pig are you in no answer i was just about to go home without the cup of sugar for my dear old granny’s birthday cake that’s when my nose started to itch i felt a sneeze coming on well i huffed and i snuffed and i sneezed a great sneeze and you know what that whore darn straw house fell down and right in the middle of the pile of straw was the first little pig dead as a doornail he had been home the whole time it seemed like a shame to leave a perfectly good ham dinner lying there in the straw so i ate it up think of it as a big cheeseburger just lying there i was feeling a little better but i still didn’t have my cup of sugar so i went to the next neighbor’s house this neighbor was the first little pig’s brother he was a little smarter but not much he had built his house of sticks i rang the bell on the stick house nobody answered i called mr pig mr pig are you in he yelled back go away wolf you can’t come in i’m shaving the hairs on my chinny chin chin i had just grabbed the doorknob when i felt another sneeze coming on i huffed and i snuffed and i tried to cover my mouth but i sneezed a great sneeze and you’re not going to believe it but this guy’s house fell down just like his brother’s when the dust cleared there was the second little pig dead as a doornail wolf’s honor now you know food will spoil if you just leave it out in the open so i did the only thing there was to do i had dinner again think of it as a second helping i was getting awfully full but my cold was feeling a little better and i still didn’t have that cup of sugar for my dear old granny’s birthday cake so i went to the next house this guy was the first and second little pigs brother he must have been the brains of the family he had built his house of bricks i knocked on the brick house no answer i called mr pig mr pig are you in and do you know what that rude little porker answered get out of here wolf don’t bother me again talk about impolite he probably had a whole sackful of sugar and he wouldn’t give me even one little cup for my dear sweet old granny’s birthday cake what a pig i was just about to go home and maybe make a nice birthday card instead of a cake when i felt my cold coming on i huffed and i snuffed and i sneezed once again then the third little pig yelled and your old granny can sit on a pin now i’m usually a pretty calm fellow but when somebody talks about my granny like that i go a little crazy when the cops drove up of course i was trying to break down this pig’s door and the whole time i was huffing and puffing and sneezing and making a real scene

santas at christmas and all the hearts on valentine’s day i need a rest your overworked friend red crayon dear duncan all right listen i love that i’m your favorite crayon for grapes dragons and wizard’s hats but it makes me crazy that so much of my gorgeous color goes outside the lines if you don’t start coloring inside the lines soon i’m going to completely lose it your very neat friend purple crayon dear duncan i’m tired of being called light brown or dark tan because i am neither i am beige and i am proud i’m also tired of being second place to mr brown crayon it’s not fair that

your beige friend beige crayon duncan gray crayon here you’re killing me i know you love elephants and i know that elephants are gray but that’s a lot of space to color in all by myself and don’t even

how about one of those once in a while to give me a break your very tired friend gray crayon dear duncan you color with me but why most of the time i’m the same color as the page you are using me on

feeling well empty we need to talk your empty friend white crayon hi duncan i hate being used to draw the outline of things things that are colored in by other colors all of which think they’re brighter than me it’s not fair when you use me to draw a nice beach ball and then fill in the colors of the ball with all the other crayons how about a black beach ball sometime is that too much to ask your friend black crayon dear duncan as green crayon i am writing for two reasons one is to say that i like my workloads of crocodiles trees dinosaurs and frogs i have no problem and wish to

embarrassed to leave the crayon box i don’t even have any underwear how would you like to go to school naked i need some clothes help your naked friend peach crayon well poor duncan just wanted to color and of course he wanted his crayons to be happy and that gave him an idea then duncan showed his teacher his new picture she gave him an a for coloring and an a for creativity arthur’s teacher mr rathburn explained the homework what should the story be about arthur asked anything mr rathburn said write about something that is important to you arthur started his story the minute he got home he knew exactly what he wanted to write about how i got my puppy pal i always wanted a dog but first i had to prove i was responsible so i started arthur’s pet business my mom made me keep all the animals in the basement it was a lot of work but it was fun until i thought i lost perky but then i found her and she had three puppies and i got to keep one of them that’s how i got my dog pal the end arthur read his story to dw that’s a boring story d.w said does it have to be real life because your life is so dull i don’t want to write a boring story said arthur if it were me d.w suggested i’d make the story about getting an elephant the next day arthur read his new story to buster did you like the part about the elephant puppies he asked it’s okay i guess said buster i’m writing a cool story about outer space maybe my story should take place on the moon thought arthur on wednesday arthur read his newest story to the brain scientifically speaking elephants would weigh less on the moon but wouldn’t float that high said the brain so you don’t like it asked arthur a good story should be well researched said the brain like mine if i had a pet stegosaurus in the jurassic period arthur hurried to the library what are all those books for asked francine research said arthur i’m writing about my pet five toed mammal of the genus loxodonta your what asked francine my elephant arthur explained oh said francine i’m putting jokes in my story all through dinner arthur worried about his story please pass the corn asked father corn that’s it said arthur purple corn and blue elephants on planet shmellafint now that’s funny arthur is acting weirder than usual said d.w on thursday everyone at the sugar bowl was talking about their stories last year a kid wrote a country western song for her story said prunella and she got an a how do you know asked arthur that kid was me explained prunella mr ratburn said i should send it to a record company it was that good wow said arthur that night arthur’s imagination went wild he decided to turn his story into a song he even made up a dance to go with it later he tried it out on his family now this little boy can go home and enjoy his own personal striped elephant and you will see how happy he will be here on planet shmellafint well said arthur what do you think mother and father smiled it’s nice said grandma thora but a little confusing too bad you can’t dance said d.w what am i going to do said arthur my story is due tomorrow that night arthur didn’t sleep very well the next day arthur worried until mr ratburn finally called on him when arthur’s song and dance was over the classroom was so quiet it was almost spooky blinky raised his hand did that really happen sort of said arthur it started as the story of how i got my dog i’d like to hear that story said mr ratburn the title was how i got my puppy pal said arthur arthur told how proud he was of his pet business and how scared he was when perky disappeared and he told how happy he was to find her under his bed and how surprised he was to see her three puppies and the best part is said arthur i got to keep one buster said i like that story better than your other one great story said blinky i think arthur’s story was the best said francine good work said mr ratburn of course i expect you to write it all down by monday then mr ratburn gave arthur a gold sticker oh and one more thing he said leave out the dancing max said max’s sister ruby it’s time for grandma’s birthday party max wound up his jellyball shooter spider the spider shot red blue and yellow jellyballs i sent out 10 party invitations max said ruby all the guests wrote back and checked the yes box will you help me put out the name cards 1 is rapunzel 2 is curly

ruby ruby went to get snappers and candy kisses max took the crown and wig off rapunzel and put them on his spider then max put rapunzel in his own seat and the jellyball shooter in rapunzel’s seat

exciting said grandma grandma made sure that the uninvited guests all had their snappers and their candy kisses and their favorite flavors of ice cream if you give a moose a muffin he’ll want some jam to go with it so you’ll bring out some of your mother’s homemade blackberry jam when he’s finished eating the muffin he’ll want another and another and another when they’re all gone he’ll ask you to make more you’ll have to go to the store to get some muffin mix he’ll want to go with you when he opens the door and feels how chilly it is he’ll ask to borrow a sweater when he puts the sweater on he’ll notice one of the buttons is loose he’ll ask for a needle and thread he’ll start sewing the button will remind him of the puppets his grandmother used to make so he’ll ask for some old socks he’ll make sock puppets when they’re done he’ll want to put on a puppet show he’ll need some cardboard and paints then he’ll ask you to help make the scenery when the scenery is finished he’ll get behind the couch but his antlers will stick out so he’ll ask for something to cover them up you’ll bring him a sheet from your bed when he sees the sheet he’ll remember he wants to be a ghost for halloween he’ll try it on and shout boo it’ll scare him so much he’ll knock over the paints so he’ll use the sheet to clean up the mess then he’ll ask for some soap to wash it out he’ll probably want to hang the sheet up to dry he’ll go outside to put it on the clothesline when he’s out in the yard he’ll see your mother’s blackberry bushes seeing the blackberries will remind him of her jam he’ll probably ask you for some and chances are if you give him the jam he’ll want a muffin to go with it what luck dinner excuse me would you care to go for a stroll hmm sure that is not a good idea would you care to continue our walk into the deep dark woods sounds fun that is really not a good idea would you care to visit my nearby kitchen i would love to that is really really not a good idea would

really not a good idea oh a key ingredient is missing you well we did try to warn him more soup children it was a happy time in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road in bear country a happy birthday time it was brother bear’s birthday and he was getting some very fine presents brother wasn’t exactly having a party but cousin fred lizzy bruin and babs bruno were there and gramps and gran of course wow said brother when he opened his present from gramps it was an aluminum bat thanks gramps i’ll hit twenty home runs with this gran’s present was a great looking warm up jacket brother tried it on and looked in the mirror thank you gran it’s really neat he said his other presents were a fielder’s glove from cousin fred a sports video from lizzy bruin and a mystery book from babs bruno sister’s very thoughtful gift was a package of balsa wood the special wood brother used for making model airplanes thank you thank you thank you all he said you’re welcome and happy birthday said the gift givers sister’s gift was thoughtful but she was being thoughtful in another way too it isn’t always easy when your brother gets a lot of presents and you don’t sister understood that she had gotten presents when it was her birthday and would again besides she wasn’t that interested in aluminum bats warm up jackets fielder’s gloves sports videos or balsa wood anyway but all that changed when mama and papa bear gave brother their present it was the biggest most beautiful racing bike sister had ever seen it had a hand brake three speeds and super sport wheels when sister saw that beautiful bike it was no longer happy birthday brother it was i gotta have that bike i gotta i gotta i gotta mama saw that i gotta have it look in sister’s eyes she took her aside and reminded her about all the wonderful presents she had gotten on her last birthday but sister didn’t hear a word mama said she just stared at that big beautiful bike with the hand brake and the super sport wheels oh dear said mama i think you’ve been taken over by the green eyed monster green eyed monster said sister what’s that oh said mama that’s just a way folks have of talking about jealousy and envy you know what it means to be jealous envy is when you want something that belongs to somebody else but mama said sister it’s such a great beautiful bike please listen to me sister said mama even if you had a bike like that you couldn’t ride it you’re not big enough your feet wouldn’t reach the pedals besides look what papa’s got for you papa was wheeling in brother’s junior size bike with its training wheels attached it’s yours now he said sister looked at the bike brother had outgrown it was okay but it didn’t have a hand brake three speeds and super sport wheels come on now said mama our guests are leaving it’s time to say good bye good bye said brother thank you all for the wonderful presents bye said sister gramps and gran got into their pickup truck and headed for home lizzy bruin got into her dad’s car with the others mr bruin had agreed to come for them and drive them home then papa helped carry the new bike down the front steps mama and papa watched proudly as brother climbed on and tried it out first brother rode big fast circles around the tree house then he did a few wheelies when he started riding with his feet up on the handlebars mama got worried now let’s not be reckless she said sister watched too she had gone inside and was watching from a window as she did so she became filled with envy from the tips of her pink hair bow down to the tips of her toenails sister really wanted that big beautiful racing bike that night sister was having trouble falling asleep because she was still thinking about the bike then just as her eyes were closing the strangest thing happened she had a visitor the visitor looked exactly like sister except she was green and had little horns on her head i know who you are sister said you’re the green eyed monster sister was having a dream of course but she didn’t know that that’s the thing about dreams they’re so real come said the green eyed monster if you want a bike like brother’s all you have to do is prove you’re big enough to ride it before she quite knew what was happening she was up on the bike and the green eyed monster was giving her a big push the bike was much too big for her her feet couldn’t even almost reach the pedals then as so often happens in dreams things began to change the bike got bigger and bigger and bigger now sister was speeding down a hill at the bottom was a great rock she smashed into it there was a huge crash brother’s beautiful new birthday bike flew into a thousand pieces what have i done she screamed what have i done mama and papa who had just fallen asleep came running into the cubs room oh mama cried sister i just smashed brother’s beautiful birthday bike into a thousand pieces a thousand pieces try to calm down sweetie said mama brother’s bike is perfectly safe you were having a dream what’s going on said brother rubbing his eyes i’ll go downstairs and get us all some warm milk said papa it’ll help us get back to sleep and it did the next day sister’s best friend lizzy came over to play she and sister had a fun time riding around the yard brother’s old bike turned out to be just right for sister lizzy had a good time on sister’s old trike and brother rode circles around them on his birthday bike later when mr bruin came over to pick up lizzy he had a very big surprise for everybody he had just traded in his old car for a beautiful brand new one and what a car it was it had wire wheels leather seats and racing stripes mama brother sister and lizzy congratulated mr bruin on his fine new car but not papa he just stood and stared he had the same i gotta have it look that sister had when she first saw brother’s new bike papa said sister i think you better watch out for you know who papa did know who mr bruin he said congratulations on a fine new car after the bruins drove away mama and papa sat on the tree house steps and watched brother and sister do some plain and fancy bike riding elizabeth was a beautiful princess she lived in a castle and had expensive princess clothes she was going to marry a prince named ronald unfortunately a dragon smashed her castle burned all her clothes with his fiery breath and carried off prince ronald elizabeth decided to chase the dragon and get ronald back she looked everywhere for something to wear but the only thing she could find that was not burnt was a paper bag so she put on the paper bag and followed the dragon he was easy to follow because he left a trail of burnt forests and horses bones finally elizabeth came to a cave with a large door that had a huge knocker on it she took hold of the knocker and banged on the door the dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said well a princess i love to eat princesses but i have already eaten a whole castle today i am a very busy dragon come back tomorrow he slammed the door so fast that elizabeth almost got her nose caught elizabeth grabbed the knocker and banged on the door again the dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said go away i love to eat princesses but i have already eaten a whole castle today i am a very busy dragon come back tomorrow wait shouted elizabeth is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world yes said the dragon fantastic said elizabeth and the dragon took another huge breath and breathed out so much fire that he burnt up one hundred forests magnificent said elizabeth and the dragon took another huge breath but this time nothing came out the dragon didn’t even have enough fire left to cook a meatball elizabeth said dragon is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds why yes said the dragon and jumped up and flew all the way around the world in just ten seconds he was very tired when he got back but elizabeth shouted fantastic do it again so the dragon jumped up and flew around the whole world in just twenty seconds when he got back he was too tired to talk and he lay down and went straight to sleep elizabeth whispered very softly hey dragon the dragon didn’t move at all she lifted up the dragon’s ear and put her head right inside she shouted as loud as she could hey dragon the dragon was so tired he didn’t even move elizabeth walked right over the dragon and opened the door to the cave there was prince ronald he looked at her and said elizabeth you are a mess you smell like ashes your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag come back when you are dressed like a real princess ronald said elizabeth your clothes are really pretty and your hair is very neat you look like a real prince but you are a bum they didn’t get married after all once upon a time a little girl named laura lived in the big woods of wisconsin in a little house made of logs laura lived in the little house with her pa her ma her big sister mary her baby sister carrie and their good old bulldog jack winter was coming to the big woods soon the little house would be covered with snow pa went hunting every day so that they would have meat during the long cold winter ma laura and mary gathered potatoes and carrots beets and turnips cabbages and onions and peppers and pumpkins from the garden next to the little house by the time winter came the little house was full of good things to eat laura and mary thought the attic was a lovely place to play they played house by using the round orange pumpkins as tables and chairs and everything was snug and cozy soon the first snow came and it was very cold in the mornings the windows were covered with beautiful frost pictures of trees and flowers and fairies ma said that jack frost came in the night and made the pictures while everyone was asleep laura and mary were allowed to use ma’s thimble to make pretty patterns of circles in the frost in the mornings laura and mary helped ma wash the dishes and make the beds after this was done ma began the work that belonged to that day each day had its own proper work ma would say wash on monday iron on tuesday mend on wednesday churn on thursday clean on friday bake on saturday rest on sunday laura liked the churning and baking days best of all ma had to churn the cream for a long time until it turned into butter mary could sometimes churn while ma rested but laura was too little on saturdays when ma made the bread laura and mary each had a little piece of dough to make into a little loaf ma even gave them a bit of cookie dough to make little cookies after the day’s work was done ma would sometimes cut out paper dolls for laura and mary she drew their faces on with a pencil and cut dresses hats and ribbons out of colored paper so that mary and laura could dress their dolls beautifully but the best time of all was at night when pa came home he would throw off his fur cap and coat and mittens and call where’s my little half pint of sweet cider half drunk up that was laura because she was so small sometimes pa would take down his fiddle and sing pa would keep time with his foot laura and mary would clap their hands to the music when he sang yankee doodle went to town he wore his striped trousies he swore he couldn’t see the town there was so many houses other times pa would tell stories when laura and mary begged him for a story he would take them on his knees and tickle their faces with his long whiskers until they laughed out loud his eyes were blue and merry outside it was cold and snowy but the little log cabin was snug and cozy pa ma laura mary and baby carrie were comfortable and happy in their little house in the big woods angelina absolutely loved snowy winter days when she could ice skate with her friends on miller’s pond the ice sparkled like glass and they raced across it in pairs practicing spins and twirls and figure eights everyone in the village was getting ready for new year’s eve and angelina was preparing a special ice skating show her little cousin henry wanted to be in the show too even though he often tumbled off the ice and fell into the snowbanks we’ll need someone to be the snow king said angelina’s friend flora pirouetting across the ice as the snow princess i’ll be the king shouted henry but then he tripped and slid into alice who was going to be the snow fairy you’d be a better snow shovel said alice crossly as she dusted off her skates don’t worry henry said angelina hold on to me and let’s practice skating together they linked their tails and tried to skate in a circle but it wasn’t easy on the slippery ice just then spike and sammy two big boys from school raced by playing hockey and almost knocked them all over hey shouted felicity but the boys were already gone laughing and yelling across the ice never mind said angelina helping felicity get her balance let me show you how to skate backwards but before long spike and sammy tore past again spraying snow in all directions when they zipped through angelina’s rehearsal a third time she got angry please stop interrupting us she scolded but the boys just laughed grabbed angelina’s scarf and tweaked flora’s whiskers little ballerinas can’t catch us they shouted as they zoomed away angelina and her friends chased spike and sammy all across the ice and then angelina made a huge snowball and hurled it at the boys great a snowball fight spike yelled throwing one back at angelina then everybody started throwing snowballs everywhere and soon miller’s pond was a blizzard of flying snow and shouting skaters they had so much fun they stayed until flora got ice down her neck and alice’s toes began to freeze then they trudged back to angelina’s house feeling tired and frozen what’s wrong asked angelina’s mother our new year’s eve ice dance is a mess said angelina sadly we haven’t got costumes or scenery and spike and sammy keep bothering us i can help you with costumes said mrs mouseling and maybe the boys are teasing you because they want you to pay attention to them angelina was surprised that gives me an idea the next day angelina put on her skates and whizzed past spike and sammy snatched their caps and raced off laughing with the boys just behind her they were very fast but angelina could do all sorts of tricky twists and spins and just as spike and sammy thought they would grab her she spun out of reach and they smashed into each other collapsing on the ice spike gazed at angelina in admiration you ballerinas are fast would you like to be in our show asked angelina tossing back their caps spike and sammy leapt up yes they shouted skating in circles around her sammy loved doing funny tricks and spike who could skate backwards was proud to be the snow king best of all they helped henry build a huge snow fort it will make a nice snow palace for our show said henry enthusiastically what a great idea admired angelina on new year’s eve the whole village dressed up and came to celebrate miller’s pond looked magical as the performers skated on to the ice in mrs mouseling’s costumes and henry’s snow fort gleamed in the moonlight when angelina danced into the spotlight that night she felt just like a real snow queen spike and sammy did exciting leaps and jumps together and henry was thrilled to be the king’s attendant while felicity flora and alice seemed to fly across the ice like delicate snowflakes at the end of the performance as the magic hour of midnight approached and fireworks sparkled in the sky angelina and her friends wished everyone joy and peace and they all sang and danced together to welcome in the new year on the fifteenth of may in the jungle of nool in the heat of the day in the cool of the pool he was splashing enjoying the jungle’s great joys when horton the elephant heard a small noise so horton stopped splashing he looked toward the sound that’s funny thought horton there’s no one around then he heard it again just a very faint yelp as if some tiny person were calling for help i’ll help you said horton but who are you where he looked and looked he could see nothing there but a small speck of dust blowing past through the air i say murmured horton i’ve never heard tell of a small speck of dust that is able to yell so you know what i think why i think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust some sort of a creature of very small size too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes some poor little person who’s shaking with fear that he’ll blow in the pool he has no way to steer i’ll just have to save him because after all a person’s a person no matter how small so gently and using the greatest of care the elephant stretched his great trunk through the air and he lifted the dust speck and carried it over and placed it down safe on a very soft clover humpf humpfed a voice twas a sour kangaroo and the young kangaroo in her pouch said humpf too why that speck is as small as the head of a pin a person on that why there never has been believe me said horton i tell you sincerely my ears are quite keen and i heard him quite clearly i know there’s a person down there and what’s more quite likely there’s two even three even four quite likely a family for all that we know a family with children just starting to grow so please horton said as a favor to me try not to disturb them just please let them be i think you’re a fool laughed the sour kangaroo and the young kangaroo in her pouch said me too you’re the biggest blame fool in the jungle of nool and the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool what terrible splashing the elephant frowned i can’t let my very small persons get drowned i’ve got to protect them i’m bigger than they so he plucked up the clover and hustled away through the high jungle tree tops the news quickly spread he talks to a dust speck he’s out of his head just look at him walk with that speck on that flower and horton walked worrying almost an hour should i put this speck down horton thought with alarm if i do these small persons may come to great harm i can’t put it down and i won’t after all a person’s a person no matter how small then horton stopped walking the speck voice was talking the voice was so faint he could just barely hear it speak up please said horton he put his ear near it my friend came the voice you’re a very fine friend you’ve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end you’ve saved all our houses our ceilings and floors you’ve saved all our churches and grocery stores you mean horton gasped you have buildings there too oh yes piped the voice we most certainly do i know called the voice i’m too small to be seen but i’m mayor of a town that is friendly and clean our buildings to you would seem terribly small but to us who aren’t big they are wonderfully tall my town is called who ville for i am a who and we whos are all thankful and grateful to you and horton called back to the mayor of the town you’re safe now don’t worry i won’t let you down but just as he spoke to the mayor of the speck three big jungle monkeys climbed up horton’s neck the wickersham brothers came shouting what rot this elephant’s talking to whos who are not there aren’t any whos and they don’t have a mayor and we’re going to stop all this nonsense so there they snatched horton’s clover they carried it off to a black bottomed eagle named vlad vlad i koff a mighty strong eagle of very swift wing and they said will you kindly get rid of this thing and before the poor elephant even could speak that eagle flew off with the flower in his beak all that late afternoon and far into the night that black bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight while horton chased after with groans over stones that tattered his toenails and battered his bones and begged please don’t harm all my little folks who have as much right to live as us bigger folks do but far far beyond him that eagle kept flapping and over his shoulder called back quit your yapping i’ll fly the night through i’m a bird i don’t mind it and i’ll hid this tomorrow where you’ll never find it and at 6 56 the next morning he did it it sure was a terrible place that he hid it he let that small clover drop somewhere inside of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide find that sneered the bird but i think you will fail and he left with a flip of his black bottomed tail i’ll find it cried horton i’ll find it or bust i shall find my friends on my small speck of dust and clover by clover by clover he found that the one that he sought for was just not around and by noon poor old horton more dead than alive had picked searched and piled up nine thousand and five then on through the afternoon hour after hour till he found them at last on the three millionth flower my friends cried the elephant tell me do tell are you safe are you sound are you whole are you well from down on the speck came the voice of the mayor we’ve really had trouble much more than our share when that black bottomed birdie let go and we dropped we landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped our tea pots are broken our rocking chairs smashed and our bicycle tires all blew up when we crashed so horton please pleaded that voice of the mayor’s will you stick by us whos while we’re making repairs of course horton answered of course i will stick i’ll stick by you small folks through thin and through thick humpf humpfed a voice for almost two days you’ve run wild and insisted on chatting with persons who’ve never existed such carryings on in our peaceable jungle we’ve had quite enough of your bellowing bungle and i’m here to state snapped the big kangaroo that your silly nonsensical game is all through and the young kangaroo in her pouch said me too with the help of the wickersham brothers and dozens of wickersham uncles and wickersham cousins and wickersham in laws whose help i’ve engaged you’re going to be roped and you’re going to be caged and as for your dust speck hah that we shall boil in a hot steaming kettle of beezle nut oil boil it gasped horton oh that you can’t do it’s all full of persons they’ll prove it to you mr mayor mr mayor horton called mr mayor you’ve got to prove now that you really are there so call a big meeting get everyone out make every who holler make every who shout make every who scream if you don’t every who is going to end up in a beezle nut stew and down on the dust speck the scared little mayor quick called a big meeting in who ville town square and his people cried loudly they cried out in fear we are here we are here we are here we are here the elephant smiled that was clear as a bell you kangaroos surely heard that very well all i heard snapped the big kangaroo was the breeze and the faint sound of wind through the far distant trees i heard no small voices and you didn’t either and the young kangaroo in her pouch said me neither grab him they shouted and cage the big dope lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope tie the knots tight so he’ll never shake loose then dunk that dumb speck in the beezle nut juice horton fought back with great vigor and vim but the wickersham gang was too many for him they beat him they mauled him they started to haul him into his cage but he managed to call to the mayor don’t give up i believe in you all a person’s a person no matter how small and you very small persons will not have to die if you make yourselves heard so come on now and try the mayor grabbed a tom tom he started to smack it and all over who ville they whooped up a racket they rattled tin kettles they beat on brass pans on garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans they blew on bazookas and blasted great toots on clarinets oom pahs and boom pahs and flutes great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air they rattled and shook the whole sky and the mayor called up through the howling mad hullabaloo hey horton how’s this is our sound coming through and horton called back i can hear you just find but the kangaroos ears aren’t as strong quite as mine they don’t hear a thing are you sure all your boys are doing their best are they all making noise are you sure every who down in who ville is working quick look through your town is there anyone shirking through the town rushed the mayor from the east to the west but everyone seemed to be doing his best everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping everyone seemed to be beeping or bipping but it wasn’t enough all this ruckus and roar he had to find someone to help him make more he raced through each building he searched floor to floor and just as he felt he was getting nowhere and almost about to give up in despair he suddenly burst through a door and that mayor discovered one shirker quite hidden away in the fairfax apartments apartment 12 j a very small very small shirker named jo jo was standing just standing and bouncing a yo yo not making a sound not a yipp not a chirp and the mayor rushed inside and he grabbed the young twerp and he climbed with the lad up the eiffelberg tower this cried the mayor is your town’s darkest hour the time for all whos who have blood that is red to come to the aid of their country he said we’ve got to make noises in greater amounts so open your mouth lad for every voice counts thus he spoke as he climbed whey they got to the top the lad cleared his throat and he shouted yopp and that yopp that one small extra yopp put it over finally at last from that speck on that clover their voices were heard they rang out clear and clean and the elephant smiled do you see what i mean they’ve proved they are persons no matter how small and their whole world was saved by the smallest of all how true yes how true said the big kangaroo and from now on you know what i’m planning to do from now on i’m going to protect them with you and the young kangaroo in her pouch said me too from sun in the summer from rain in when it’s fall ish i’m going to protect them no matter how small ish it was breakfast time and everyone was at the table father was eating his egg mother was eating her egg gloria was sitting in a high chair and eating her egg too frances was eating bread and jam what a lovely egg said father if there is one thing i am fond of for breakfast it is a soft boiled egg yes said mother spooning up egg for the baby it is just the thing to start the day off right ah said gloria and ate up her egg frances did not eat her egg she sang a little song to it she sand the song very softly i do not like the way you slide i do not like your soft inside i do not like you lots of ways and i could do for many days without eggs what did you say frances asked father nothing said frances spreading jam on another slice of bread why do you keep eating bread and jam asked father when you have a lovely soft boiled egg one of the reasons i like bread and jam said frances is that it does not slide off your spoon in a funny way well of course said father not everyone is fond of soft boiled eggs for breakfast but there are other kinds of eggs there are sunny side up and sunny side down eggs yes said frances but sunny side up eggs lie on the plate and look up at you in a funny way and sunny side down eggs just lie on their stomachs and wait what about scrambled eggs said father scrambled eggs fall off the fork and roll under the table said frances i think it is time for you to go to school now said mother frances picked up her books her lunch box and her skipping rope then she kissed mother and father good bye and went to the bus stop while she waited for the bus she skipped and sang jam on biscuits jam on toast jam is the thing that i like most jam is sticky jam is sweet jam is tasty jam’s a treat raspberry strawberry gooseberry i’m very fond of jam that evening for dinner mother cooked breaded veal cutlets with string beans and baked potatoes ah said father what is there handsomer on a plate and tastier to eat than breaded veal cutlet it is a nice dish isn’t it said mother eat up the string bean gloria oh said gloria and ate it up she had already eaten her dinner of strained beef and sweet potatoes but she liked to practice with a string bean when she could where do breaded veal cutlets come from asked frances and why are french cut stringless beans called string beans we can talk about that another time said father now it is time to eat our dinner frances looked at her plate and sang what do cutlets wear before they’re breaded flannel nightgowns cowboy boots furry jackets sailor suits then she spread jam on a slice of bread and took a bite she won’t try anything new said mother to father she just eats bread and jam how do you know what you’ll like if you won’t even try anything asked father well said frances there are many different things to eat and they taste many different ways but when i have bread and jam i always know what i am getting and i am always pleased you try new things in your school lunches said mother today i gave you a chicken salad sandwich there now said father to frances wasn’t it good well said frances i traded it to albert for what said father bread and jam said frances the next morning at breakfast father sat down and said now i call that a pretty sight fresh orange juice and poached eggs on toast there’s a proper breakfast for you thank you for saying so said mother poached eggs on toast do have a cheery look i think frances began to sing a poached egg song poached eggs on toast why do you shiver with such a funny little quiver then she looked down and saw that she did not have a poached egg i have no poached egg said frances i have nothing but orange juice i know said mother why is that said frances everybody else has a poached egg even gloria has a poached egg and she is nothing but a baby but you do not like eggs said mother and that is why i did not poach one for you have some bread and jam if you are hungry so frances ate bread and jam and went to school when the bell rang for lunch frances sat down next to her friend albert what do you have today said frances i have a cream cheese cucumber and tomato sandwich on rye bread said albert and a pickle to go with it and a hard boiled egg and a little cardboard shaker of salt to go with that and a thermos bottle of milk and a bunch of grapes and a tangerine and a cup custard and a spoon to eat it with what do you have frances opened her lunch bread and jam she said and milk you’re lucky said albert that’s just what you like you don’t have to trade now that’s right said frances and i had bread and jam for dinner last night and for breakfast this morning you certainly are lucky said albert yes said frances i am a very lucky girl i guess but i’ll trade you if you want to that’s all right said albert i like cream cheese with cucumbers and tomatoes on rye albert took two napkins from his lunch box he tucked one napkin under his chin he spread the other one on his desk like a tablecloth he arranged his lunch neatly on the napkin with his spoon he cracked the shell of the hard boiled egg he peeled away the shell and bit off the end of the egg he sprinkled salt on the yolk and set the egg down again he unscrewed his thermos bottle cup and filled it with milk then he was ready to eat his lunch he took a bite of sandwich a bite of pickle a bite of hard boiled egg and a drink of milk then he sprinkled more salt on the egg and went around again albert made the sandwich the pickle the egg and the milk come out even he ate his bunch of grapes and his tangerine then he cleared away the crumpled up waxed paper the eggshell and the tangerine peel he set the cup custard in the middle of the napkin on his desk he took up his spoon and ate up all the custard then albert folded up his napkins and put them away he put away his cardboard saltshaker and his spoon he screwed the cup on top of his thermos bottle he shut his lunch box put it back inside his desk and sighed i like to have a good lunch said albert frances ate her bread and jam and drank her milk then she went out to the playground and skipped rope she did not skip as fast and she had skipped in the morning and she sang jam in the morning jam at noon bread and jam by the light of the moon jam is very nice when frances got home from school mother said i know you like to have a little snack when you get home from school and i have one all ready for you i do like snacks said frances running to the kitchen here it is said mother a glass of milk and some nice bread and jam for you aren’t you worried that maybe i will get sick and all my teeth will fall out from eating so much bread and jam asked frances i don’t think that will happen for quite a while said mother so eat it all up and enjoy it frances ate up most of her bread and jam but she did not eat all of it after her snack she went outside to skip rope frances skipped a little more slowly than she had skipped at noon and she sang jam for snacks and jam for meals i know how a jam jar feels full of jam that evening for dinner mother cooked spaghetti and meatballs with tomato sauce i am glad to see there will be enough for second helpings said father because spaghetti and meatballs is one of my favorite dishes spaghetti and meatballs is a favorite with everybody said mother try a little spaghetti gloria um said gloria and tried the spaghetti frances looked down at her plate and saw that there was no spaghetti and meatballs on it there was a slice of bread and a jar of jam frances began to cry my goodness said mother frances is crying what is the matter asked father frances looked down at her plate and sang a little sad song she sang so softy that mother and father could scarcely hear her what i am is tired of jam i want spaghetti and meatballs said frances may i have some please i had no idea you liked spaghetti and meatballs said mother how do you know what i’ll like if you won’t even try me asked frances wiping her eyes so mother gave frances spaghetti and meatballs and she ate it all up the next day when the bell rang for lunch albert said what do you have today well said frances laying a paper doily on her desk and setting a tiny vase of violets in the middle of it let me see she arranged her lunch on the doily i have a thermos bottle with cream of tomato soup she said and a lobster salad sandwich on thin slices of white bread i have celery carrot sticks and black olives and a little cardboard shaker of salt for the celery and two plums and a tiny basket of cherries and vanilla pudding with chocolate sprinkles and a spoon to eat it with that’s a good lunch said albert i think it’s nice that there are all different kinds of lunches and breakfasts and dinners and snacks i think eating is nice so do i said frances and she made the lobster salad sandwich the celery the carrot sticks and the olives come out even the end this is princess she is a show dog here we see her practicing for a dog show competition notice the perfect posture strong back perfect round puffy tail

number one split pea soup martha was very fond of making split pea soup sometimes she made it all day long pots and pots of split pea soup if there was one thing that george was not fond of it was split pea soup as a matter of fact george hated split pea soup more than anything else in the world but it was so hard to tell martha one day after george had eaten ten bowls of martha’s soup he said to himself i just can’t stand another bowl not even another spoonful so while martha was out in the kitchen george carefully poured the rest of his soup into his loafers under the table now she will think i have eaten it but martha was watching from the kitchen how do you expect to walk home with your loafers full of split pea soup she asked george oh dear said george you saw me and why didn’t you yell me that you hate my split pea soup i didn’t want to hurt your feelings said george that’s silly said martha friends should always tell each other the truth as a matter of fact i don’t like split pea soup very much myself i only like to make it from now on you’ll never have to eat that awful soup again what a relief george sighed would you like some chocolate chip cookies instead asked martha oh that would be lovely said george then you shall have them said his friend story number two the flying machine i’m going to be the first of my species to fly said george they why aren’t you flying asked martha it seems to me that you are still on the ground you are right said george i don’t seem to be going anywhere at all maybe the basket is too heavy said martha yes said george i think you are right again maybe if i climb out the basket will be lighter oh dear cried george now what have i done there goes my flying machine that’s all right said martha i would rather have you down here with me story number three george was fond of peeking in windows one day george peeked in on martha he never did that again we are friends said martha but there is such a thing as privacy story number four the mirror how i love to look at myself in the mirror said martha every chance she got martha looked at herself in the mirror sometimes martha even woke up during the night to look at herself the is fun she giggled but george was getting tired of watching martha look at herself in the mirror one day george pasted a silly picture he had drawn of martha onto the mirror what a scare it gave martha oh dear she cried what has happened to me that’s what happens when you look at yourself too much in the mirror said george then i won’t do it ever again said martha and she didn’t the last story the tooth one day when george was skating to martha’s house he tripped and fell and he broke off his right front tooth his favorite tooth too when he got to martha’s george cried his eyes out oh dear me he cried i look so funny without my favorite tooth there there said martha the next day george went to the dentist the dentist replaced george’s missing tooth with a lovely gold one when martha saw george’s lovely new golden tooth she was very happy george she exclaimed you look so handsome and distinguished with your new tooth and george was happy too that’s what friends are for he said they always look on the bright side and they always know how to cheer you up but they also tell you the truth said martha with a smile the lupine lady lives in a small house overlooking the sea in between the rocks around her house grow blue and purple and rose colored flowers the lupine lady is little and old but she has not always been that way i know she is my great aunt and she told me so once upon a time she was a little girl named alice who lived in a city by the sea from the front stoop she could see the wharves and the bristling masts of tall ships many years ago her grandfather had come to america on a large sailing ship now he worked in the shop at the bottom of the house making figureheads for the prows of ships and carving indians out of wood to put in front of cigar stores for alice’s grandfather was an artist he pained pictures too of sailing ships and places across the sea when he was very busy alice helped him put in the skies in the evening alice sat on her grandfather’s knee and listened to his stories of faraway places when he had finished alice would say when i grow up i too will go to faraway places and when i grow old i too will live beside the sea that is all very well little alice said her grandfather but there is a third thing you must do what is that asked alice you must do something to make the world more beautiful said her grandfather all right said alice but she did not know what that could be in the meantime alice got up and washed her face and ate porridge for breakfast she went to school and came home and did her homework and pretty soon she was grown up then my great aunt alice set out to do the three things she had told her grandfather she was going to do she left home and went to live in another city far from the sea and the salt air there she worked in a library dusting books and keeping them from getting mixed up and helping people find the ones they wanted some of the books told her about faraway places people called her miss rumphius now sometimes she went to the conservatory in the middle of the park when she stepped inside on a wintry day the warm moist air wrapped itself around her and the sweet smell of jasmine filled her nose this is almost like a tropical isle said miss rumphius but not quite so miss rumphius went to a real tropical island where people kept cockatoos and monkeys as pets she walked on long beaches picking up beautiful shells one day she met the bapa raja king of a fishing village you must be tired he said come into my house and rest so miss rumphius went in and met the bapa raja’s wife the bapa raja himself fetched a green coconut and cut a slice off the top so that miss rumphius could drink the coconut water inside before she left the bapa raja gave her a beautiful mother of pearl shell on which he had painted a bird of paradise and the words you will always remain in my heart you will always remain in mine too said miss rumphius my great aunt miss alice rumphius climbed tall mountains where the snow never melted she went through jungles and across deserts she saw lions playing and kangaroos jumping and everywhere she made friends she would never forget finally she came to the land of the lotus eaters and there getting off a camel she hurt her back what a foolish thing to do said miss rumphius well i have certainly seen faraway places maybe it is time to find my place by the sea and it was and she did from the porch of her new house miss rumphius watched the sun come up she watched it cross the heavens and sparkle on the water and she saw it set in glory in the evening she started a little garden among the rocks that surrounded her house and she planted a few flower seeds in the stony ground miss rumphius was almost perfectly happy but there is still one more thing i have to do she said i have to do something to make the world more beautiful but what the world already is pretty nice she thought looking out over the ocean the next spring miss rumphius was not very well her back was bothering her again and she had to stay in bed most of the time the flowers she had planted the summer before had come up and bloomed in spite of the stony ground she could see them from her bedroom window blue and purple and rose colored lupines said miss rumphius with satisfaction i have always loved lupines the best i wish i could plant more seeds this summer so that i could have still more flowers next year but she was not able to after a hard winter spring came miss rumphius was feeling much better now she could take walks again one afternoon she started to go up and over the hill where she had not been in a long time i don’t believe my eyes she cried when she got to the top for there on the other side of the hill was a large patch of blue and purple and rose colored lupines it was the wind she said as she knelt in delight it was the wind that brought the seeds from my garden here and the birds must have helped then miss rumphius had a wonderful ideal she hurried home and got out her seed catalogues she sent off to the very best seed house for five bushels of lupine seed all that summer miss rumphius her pockets full of seeds wandered over fields and headlands sowing lupines she scattered seeds along the highways and down the country lanes she flung handfuls of them around the schoolhouse and back of the church she tossed them into hollows and along stone walls her back didn’t hurt her any more at all now some people called her that crazy old lady the next spring there were lupines everywhere fields and hillsides were covered with blue and purple and rose colored flowers they bloomed along the highways and down the lanes bright patches lay around the schoolhouse and back of the church down in the hollows and along the stone walls grew the beautiful flowers miss rumphius had done the third the most difficult thing of all my great aunt alice miss rumphius is very old now her hair is very white every year there are more and more lupines now they call her the lupine lady sometimes my friends stand with me outside her gate curious to see the old old lady who planted the fields of lupines when she invites us in they come slowly they think she is the oldest woman in the world often she tells us stories of faraway places when i grow up i tell her i too will go to faraway places and come home to live by the sea that is all very well little alice says my aunt but there is a third thing you must do what is that i ask you must do something to make the world more beautiful all right i say but i do not know yet what that can be august 27 1935 dear uncle jim grandma told us after supper that you want me to come to the city and live with you until things get better did she tell you that papa

word he was pulled form the tray and placed in a paper bag of his very own good bye everyone thank you mr bing have a nice day arnie heard the baker say to the man mr bing that’s a fine name arnie decided i can hardly wait to meet him good bye arnie we’ll miss you arnie i should have talked to him while i had the chance the grand exit that arnie’s imagining the ride to mr bing’s apartment was a little bumpy arnie was grateful for the soft napkin the baker had so thoughtfully placed underneath him in the bag jump you’re outta there bumps more bumps bumpy humps he had never ridden in a car and wished he could look out the window to see all the sights nut more than anything he wished he could meet mr bing why does he keep me in this bag arnie wondered grump on a stump get those words off my lawn clumps of bumps bumps and lumps finally the car came to a stop and they were home mr bing carefully removed arnie from his paper bag and placed him on a clean shiny plate what a handsome plate arnie said to himself i’m not crazy about the design i prefer a more modern look but it’s nothing a little paint can’t fix chocolate milk mr bing gently lifted arnie from his new plate isn’t that cute thought arnie as he closed his eyes and smiled he wants to hold me as arnie relaxed in mr bing’s hand he felt himself moving higher and higher away from his plate when he opened his eyes to see where he was going he discovered that he was headed straight for mr bing’s open mouth what are you doing shouted arnie mr bing was stunned he dropped arnie back onto the plate i was going to eat you he replied in shock eat me arnie shrieked his sprinkles flying everywhere why would you do a thing like that do you make a habit of eating all your houseguests nnnno of course not so why then did it suddenly occur to you to eat me arnie demanded well because you’re a doughnut that’s what doughnuts are for to eat do you mean to tell me you’ve done this before yes i eat a doughnut every day mr bing said sheepishly arnie froze he felt sick and frightened and angry ugggh i’d better get out of here before he tries to eat me again well that explains why my friends never write or call they’ve probably all been eaten he thought to himself for a moment i must put a stop to this right away i’ll call the bakery and warn the others whoever’s left that is arnie knew that there was no time to waste and that he needed to be very sneaky in order to keep his plan from mr bing he turned to mr bing and said in his sweetest voice excuse me sir but i don’t believe we’ve been properly introduced my name is arnie um hello arnie mr bing stammered it’s nice to eat you i mean meet you mr bing would you be a dear and allow me to use your telephone arnie asked extra politely oh well okay said mr bing and he handed arnie the phone as quickly as he could arnie dialed the number of the bakery still shocked to actually be talking to a doughnut the baker answered the phone downtown bakery home of the best mr baker man arnie frantically whispered this is arnie the doughnut do you remember me you made me at 5 15 this morning and i was bought about twenty minutes ago by a man who goes by the name of br bing yes arnie the baker answered what can i do for you now i don’t want to alarm you but just moments ago that man tried to eat me and not only that he claims to have eaten hundreds of us i’m going to make a run for it but i wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again you can stop him oh my arnie i thought you understood that’s why i make doughnuts for people to eat i can’t believe it arnie gasped are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement well i think so the baker said let me ask them to make sure showing signs of doughnut shock popped up eyebrow sprinkles bugged out eyeballs overall dazed expression severe sprinkle loss weak in the knees feels like someone punched a hole right through him the baker yelled to the other doughnuts do you doughnuts know that you’re going to be eaten yes we know the doughnuts shouted back we’re delicious we’re very popular people love us c’est magnifique try us for yourself is he going a little kooky kooky or cookie did you hear that arnie the baker asked arnie was crushed the phone dropped from his hand he’d heard all he needed to hear arnie forgot all about his plan to escape he collapsed back onto the plate glanced up at mr bing and muttered all right then let’s get this over with go ahead and eat me mr bing gazed down at arnie i’m not going to eat you arnie he said reassuringly i just wouldn’t feel right about it now really arnie said with a huge sigh of relief well i’m glad to see that you’ve come to your senses but since i’m not going to eat you mr bing continues i’ll have to figure our something else to do with you i paid good money for you i don’t want to be wasteful of course not arnie agreed what we need to do is each make a list of things i can do with you instead of eating you between the two of us i know we’ll come up with something good plan mr bing arnie said this will be a breeze i bet i’m good at lots of stuff they both feverishly wrote down their ideas when they were finished mr bing asked would you like to read yours first sure thing mr bing arnie answered things mr bing can do with me instead of eating me do you need a ballroom dance partner no i don’t

hat about a doorstop thanks arnie try again but there was nothing else on mr bing’s list they were both completely out of ideas arnie and mr bing were exhausted they felt terribly disappointed after a few minutes of awkward silence mr bing finally spoke i’m sorry arnie but it’s clear that we can’t agree on anything for you to do around here this is difficult for me to say but i think it would be best if you found another home i know said arnie fighting back tears i’ll just be on my way then is it all right if i keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles of course mr bing replied sadly as soon as i get a job i’ll pay you back the money you spent on me that’s not necessary arnie good bye arnie we’ve got some lovely parting gifts for you arnie shook mr bing’s hand and thanked him for his kindness mr bing opened the door and as arnie left he paused and said i guess doughnuts really are only good for eating aren’t they they both waved good bye and arnie was gone mr bing stood at the window and watched as arnie walked away he walked past the flower beds the mailboxes and the apartment manager’s office you can have my limited time offer for an interest free credit card no mail for me office now leasing is there anything worse than a sad pastry remember how happy i was at the beginning of the story i can’t read but you sure looked happy he passed the tennis court the swimming pool and the clubhouse but when arnie reached the no dogs allowed sign at the end of the driveway mr bing suddenly came up with a new idea oopsie sometimes life feels like a big bonk on the head technically i’m food so i guess a quick dip in the pool is out no food in pool area is that a doughnut yeah whatever anyway about my trip abroad no dogs allowed bye arnie the fastest mr bing’s moved in years arnie arnie wait up yelled mr bing as he ran after him arnie turned back and stopped when mr bing caught up with him he was out of breath i can’t believe i didn’t think of this earlier mr bing panted arnie i’ve always wanted a dog and could never have one because they’re not allowed here but there’s no sign that says no doughnuts allowed arnie perked up when he realized that mr bing was thinking keep talkin big guy no dogs allowed would you like to take walks and play fetch mr bing asked excitedly you bet i would can you do tricks like rolling over rolling over look at me i was made for rolling over well then there’s only one thing left to ask arnie will you be my doughnut dog oh mr bing i would love to be your doughnut dog it’s a wacky idea but it just might work from that moment on arnie and mr bing were inseparable arnie liked being a doughnut dog even better than he liked being a doughnot get it arnie take pine pet groomers bye arnie buy mr bing i got the deluxe

mom i yelled it was a triceratops what cried my mom she did not look happy how are we supposed to get that home the bakery lady smiled oh don’t worry he’ll follow you they always do and he did all the way to the doctor’s office where i had to go for my checkup my mom shook her head what are we going to do with him now she looked him up and down that took a while we can’t bring him inside she said finally he’ll have to stay in the parking lot i told him not to talk to strangers after my checkup i asked for a sticker like usual no stickers today said the nurse just dinosaurs with a shot you get

day the nurse explained today dinosaurs come with everything yessss i said noooo my mom groaned we walked down the street and my triceratops and my stegosaurus walked right behind us thud thud thud they made friends right away across the street other kids had dinosaurs too i saw an ankylosaur a duckbill and a velociraptor we all waved at each other our mothers glared and kept on walking i think we’d better go home right now my mom said but what about my haircut the barber’s waiting for me my mom looked at the dinosaurs then she looked at my bangs the barber always gives you a balloon doesn’t he a nice balloon uh huh i said i didn’t want a balloon i wanted a barosaur at the barbershop i gave my triceratops and my stegosaurus doughnuts for a snack they waited outside and watched through the glass the barber pumped the chair up high he cut my hair too short but i didn’t mind because then he patted my head and said wait right here sport he was gone for a long time my mom tapped her foot i don’t like this she said where exactly do they keep the balloons just then the barber came back with something flying over his head it wasn’t a balloon mom i yelled it was a pterosaur this is too much my mom protested now listen she said to the barber i think a balloon will do just fine today don’t you have any balloons sorry lady no balloons you get one of these instead it was like that everywhere we went at the shoe store the sign read buy two pair get dinosaur free my mom decided my shoes would last a while longer at the theater we could hear the popcorn man shouting butter no butter you want a dinosaur with that my mom said we’d go to the movies another day at the diner i wanted to stop for a hamburger but then a girl walked out with a tyrannosaurus rex okay that’s it my mom cried we are definitely not having lunch there she looked at my triceratops my stegosaurus and my pterosaur what are we supposed to do with all of these dinosaurs we don’t have room for them we can’t take care of them i hugged her leg don’t worry mom they can live in the backyard my mom shook her head sweetheart they’re not toys dinosaurs are a lot of work but mom look they eat anything and they sleep outside i’ll do everything i promise please mom please my mom sighed well i suppose we can’t just leave them here thank heavens we didn’t stop at the diner we hurried home and my dinosaurs hurried after us thud thud thud flap flap flap when we were almost there we saw a little duckbill dinosaur standing alone on the street corner he looked lost mom that’s a baby hardosaur he’s all by himself sweetie we’ve already got our hands full the hadrosaur followed us it wasn’t my fault when we got home my mom needed to lie down so i made lunch for the dinosaurs then i showed them where to go to the bathroom i told them to stay out of the neighbor’s yard because of his mean dog and i showed them my slide my tire swing and all the toys in the garage they seemed to be having fun but they really went wild when i took out my frisbee the hadrosaur had the first throw the frisbee landed on the roof i saw my mom watching from the window is everything all right out there she asked everything’s fine mom we can get it down and my pterosaur flew up and plucked the frisbee out of the gutter my mom kept watching she looked at him for a long time the next thing i knew she had him cleaning the gutters then she came out to the backyard with a pile of wet clothes these spikes come in handy don’t they she said pretty soon my mom had thought of chores for all of my dinosaurs but i knew they didn’t mind it just meant they were part of the family when we were finished helping my mom said i could invite some friends over it was a bring your own dinosaur party and guess what happened next i heard my mom on the phone to the bakery she asked do you have any doughnuts left and that’s when i knew everything would be just fine the train leaves in minutes passengers buy tickets and rush across the floor to where the train is humming on its tracks conductors look up the platform they check their watches one minute hats wave whistles blow all aboard not all a passenger jumps on at the last second the doors whoosh shut the train pulls out of the station and out of the city the train is a red striped commuter train the conductor swings down the aisle shouts tickets please and snaps holes in the tickets with his punch the train clatters past ball fields and bridges past backyards and ponds main streets flash by the view changes every second hello town good bye town on to the next town the commuter train slows with creaking brakes announcements crackle some words get lost we are arriving at ghblighrrfzze the train stops at a small station passengers off passengers on as the commuter train waits another train roars past on another track a larger train a bright blue passenger train hurrying between cities the train is late so up in the cab of the engine the engineer pulls back the throttle the passenger train powers forward it hurtles past barns and farmhouses the engine is so big it makes other big things look small the engineer sits very still but his fingers are always moving pushing levers turning dials he taps a blue button long long short long and the horn blares out across a valley of fields and steeples as the train approaches a rail crossing it sounds like a storm as the train passes it sounds like dropped pots and pans as the train leaves it sounds like the da dum da dum of a beating heart then silence but up ahead the passenger train keeps going thundering into the outskirts of a midwestern city filled with smokestacks and factories and belching steam tracks weave in and out small animals scurry under the tracks the passenger train crawls over the tracks through a jungle of gravel wires and dirt everything smells of grease and rust and burnt toast the train lurches up to the station bells ring doors open passengers off passengers on tall men with red caps unload luggage and wheel it through the echoing hall in the rail yard next to the station another train works an orange freight train loading up it grumbles under its breath as railcars are hauled and hitched to its back the railcars are filled with steel concrete oil wheat corn and lumber things used to make other things sturdy things all crammed in containers the color of tomatoes and eggs thick white letters cover the railcar sides graffiti paints their sides too after the railcars are linked into one long train the freight train creeps out of the city and across the great plains it rolls past wheat and prairie grasses past silos and barbed wire past a lone hawk circling under a big western sky the freight train rolls slower than slow so slow it’s hard to tell it’s moving as if the train and the clouds above were having a race to see which can go slower slow sloooow and like the clouds the train does not stop even as it inches up among low hills then another train passes a dark green overnight train switchbacking westward it climbs over the rocky mountains through snow flurries and pine forests the train curves along icy rivers and shoots through tunnels where its chatter turns into a whisper there are no roads outside just eagles elk and turkeys as the sun lowers passengers gather in the dining car where the waiter sways down the aisle with her tray she doesn’t spill a thing plates of meat loaf potatoes ice cream and pie a movable feast in the sleeping car two girls unfold seats into beds and make the room their own little sink little shower everything little the girls sleep as the train curls through the mountains and into the night the moon rises wherever the train goes the moon follows when the train stops the moon stops when the train starts the moon starts sometimes it hides behind a ridge then hello friend reappears the train rests in small towns passengers off passengers on stars blink in the cold air lights blink on the horizon and the overnight train pushes into the deep hours of the night and wakes to morning sun passengers wake to biscuits butter jam and coffee outside everything is different mountains have turned into orchards snow into grass boulders into cattle now accelerating into view across a wide green valley one last train passes a sleek and white high speed train blurring a streak across the land schwooosshhhh the high speed train flies it glides over bridges and marshes by bays and highways inside it is cool and quiet the train is a small world moving through a larger world passengers read or type one whispers in her phone we’re almost there we’ll see you soon the high speed train races toward the city on the coast and the passengers prepare for the end of their journey they close their books they pack their bags they think about what’s next a clean bed a warm dinner they are almost home and with a slowing turn into the station and an easing of speed and a sigh of brakes and a gentle last thunk the train stops
