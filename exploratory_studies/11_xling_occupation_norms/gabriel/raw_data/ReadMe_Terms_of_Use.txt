All rights to materials placed on the Psychonomic Society web archive remain with the author(s) who have provided them. By making the materials available for archiving, the authors represent that they hold appropriate rights to the materials.  If any of the archived materials depend or are based on the work of others, the authors must obtain prior permission from the originators to use the materials, and acknowledge and cite the appropriate sources in both the archive and article.  The authors also agree to the non-commercial use of the materials by other researchers or educators, with the stipulation that any publications or presentations that are facilitated by such use will cite both the originating article and the web materials that were downloaded. For example an article that used the web-based norms that had been archived in association with a hypothetical paper by Smith (2004) would cite both the published paper and the retrieved norms.
