# Study 1: Relating gender biases in distributional semantics and human behavior 

Are participants' gender biases predictable from the language they speak? Both the language-as-reflection and language-as-causal-factor hypotheses predict a positive correlation between the two, but showing that such a relationship exists is the first step to investigating a possible causal link. We begin by validating word embedding measures of gender bias by comparing them to explicit human judgements of word genderness (Study 1a). We then apply this method to models trained on text in other languages (Study 1b). We find that the  implicit gender bias of participants in a country is correlated with the gender bias in the language spoken in that country.


## Study 1a: Word embeddings as a measure of psychological gender bias

### Methods

         word = tolower(word)) %>%

  summarize(maleness_norm = mean(maleness_norm))  # take the mean across multiple sense of word

wiki_male_bias <- read_csv(EMBEDDING_BIAS_WIKI) %>%
  rename(maleness_embedding_wiki = male_score)

embedding_ratings <- sub_male_bias %>%
  full_join(wiki_male_bias, by = "word") %>%
  select(word, contains("embedding")) %>%
  filter_at(vars(contains("embedding")), any_vars(!is.na(.)))

MALE_WORDS <- c("son", "his","him","he", "brother","boy", "man", "male")
FEMALE_WORDS <- c("daughter", "hers", "her", "she",  "sister", "girl", "woman", "female")

  filter(!(word %in% c(MALE_WORDS, FEMALE_WORDS)))
```

To model word meanings, we use semantic embeddings derived from a model that learns meanings by trying to predict a word from surrounding words, given a large corpus. The core assumption of these models is that the meaning of a word can be described by the words it tends to co-occur with---words occurring in similar contexts, tend to have similar meanings [@firth1957synopsis]. A word like "dog," for example is represented as more similar to "cat" and "hound" than to "banana" because "dog" co-occurs with words more in common with "cat" and "hound" than with "banana" [@landauer1997solution; @lund1996producing]. Recent developments in machine learning allow the idea of distributional semantics to be implemented in a way that takes into account many features of language structure while remaining computationally tractable. The best known of these word embedding models is _word2vec_ [@mikolov2013efficient]. By attempting to predict the words that surround another word, the model is able to learn a vector-based representation for each word that represents its similarity to other words, i.e., a semantic embedding. We can then compute the similarity between two words by taking the distance between their vectors (e.g., cosine of angle). 

In order to validate word embeddings as a measure of psychological gender bias, we used an existing set of word norms in which participants were asked to rate "the gender associated with each word" on a Likert scale ranging from _very feminine_ (1) to _very masculine_  [7; @scott2018glasgow]. We compared these norms to estimates of gender bias  obtained from embedding models pre-trained on two different corpora of English text: Wikipedia [@bojanowski2016enriching] and subtitles from movies and TV shows [@vanparidon;@lison].  The Wikipedia corpus is a large, naturalistic corpus of written language; the Subtitle corpus is a smaller corpus of spoken language. Both models were trained using  the fastText algorithm [a variant of word2vec; @joulin2016bag]. There were `r format(nrow(all_ratings), big.mark = ",")` words in total that overlapped between the word-embedding models and human ratings.

Using the word embeddings, we calculated an estimate of gender bias for each word by measuring the average cosine distance to a standard set of male "anchor" words ("male," "man," "he," "boy," "his," "him," "son," and "brother"; Nosek, Banaji, \& Greenwald, 2002) and the average cosine similarity to a set of female words ("female,"  "woman," "she," "girl," "hers," "her," "daughter," and "sister"). A gender score for each word was then obtained by taking the difference of the similarity estimates (mean male similarity - mean female similarity), such that larger values indicated a stronger association with males.

Estimates of gender bias from the Subtitle corpus (_M_ = `r round(mean(all_ratings$maleness_embedding_sub),2)`; _SD_=  `r round(sd(all_ratings$maleness_embedding_sub),2)`) and  the Wikipedia corpus (_M_ = `r round(mean(all_ratings$maleness_embedding_wiki),2)`; _SD_ =  `r round(sd(all_ratings$maleness_embedding_wiki),2)`) were highly correlated with each other (_r_ = `r round(model_gender_score_corr$estimate, 2)`; _p_ <  .0001). Critically, bias estimates from both word embedding models were also highly correlated with human judgements (_M_ = `r round(mean(all_ratings$maleness_norm),2)`; _SD_ =  `r round(sd(all_ratings$maleness_norm),2)`; _r_~Subtitle~ = `r round(sub_gender_score_corr$estimate, 2)`; _p_ <  .0001; _r_~Wikipedia~ = `r round(wiki_gender_score_corr$estimate, 2)`; _p_ <  .0001; Fig. 1). This suggests that the psychological gender bias of a word can be reasonably estimated from word embeddings. 


## Study 1b: Gender bias across languages
Having validated our method, we now use it to examine the relationship between psychological and linguistic gender biases. In Study 1b, we estimate the magnitude of the linguistic bias in the dominant language spoken in each country represented in the Project Implicit dataset, and compare this estimate to estimates of psychological gender bias from the Project Implicit participants. 


### Methods
Previous work has shown biases studied using IATs can be predicted from the distributional statistics of language (word co-occurrences). Using these statistics, Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan (2017; henceforth, CBN) measured the distance between the words presented to participants in the IAT task. CBN found that these distances were highly correlated with the biases computed by a variety of IATs (e.g., valence and Caucasian vs. African-American names; gender and math vs. arts; permanence and mental vs. physical diseases). CBN only measured semantic biases in English. Here, we extend CBNâ€™s method to 25 languages examining whether languages with a stronger gender bias as expressed in distributional semantics predict stronger implicit and explicit gender biases on a large dataset of previously administered gender-career IATs.

We identified the most frequently spoken language in each country in our analysis using Ethnologue [@simons2018]. After exclusions (see below), our final sample included `r nrow(all_es) - 1` languages.\footnote{Note that while Hindi is identified as the most frequently spoken language in India, India is highly multilingual and so Hindi embeddings may be a poor representation of  the linguistic statistics for speakers in India as a group.} For each language, we obtained translations from native speakers for the stimuli in the Project Implicit gender-career IAT behavioral task  [@nosek2002harvesting] with one slight modification. In the behavioral task, proper names were used to cue the male and female categories (e.g.\ "John," "Amy"), but because there are not direct translation equivalents of proper names, we instead used a set of generic gendered words which had been previously used for a different version of the gender IAT [e.g., "man," "woman;" @nosek2002harvesting]. Our linguistic stimuli were therefore a set of 8 female and 8 male Target Words (identical to Study 1a), and the set of 8 Attribute Words words used in the Project Implicit gender-career IAT: 8 related to careers ("career," "executive,"    "management,"   "professional," "corporation,"  "salary," "office," "business") and 8 related to families ("family," "home,"      "parents,"   "children,"  "cousins,"  "marriage,"  "wedding," "relatives"). For one language, Filipino, we were unable to obtain translations from a native speaker, and so Filipino translations were compiled from dictionaries.

We used these translations to calculate a gender bias effect size from word embedding models trained on text in each language. Our effect size measure is a standardized difference score of the relative similarity of the target words to the target attributes (i.e.\ relative similarity of male to career vs.\ relative similarity of female to career). Our effect size measure is identical to that used by CBN with an exception for grammatically gendered languages (see SM for replication of CBN on our corpora). Namely, for languages with grammatically gendered Attribute Words (e.g., ni&ntilde;as for female children in Spanish), we calculated the relationship between Target Words and Attribute Words of the same gender (i.e.\ "hombre" (man) to "ni&ntilde;os" and "mujer" (woman) to "ni&ntilde;as"). In cases where there were multiple translations for a word, we averaged across words such that each of our target words was associated with a single vector in each language. In cases where the translation contained multiple words, we used the entry for the multiword phrase in the model when present, and averaged across words otherwise. Like the psychological measures of bias from the Project Implicit data, larger values indicate larger gender bias.

We calculated gender bias estimates using the same word embedding models as in Study 1a (Subtitle and Wikipedia corpora). We excluded languages from the analysis for which 20% or more of the target words were missing from the model or the model did not exist. This led us to exclude one language (Zulu) from the analysis of the Wikipedia corpus and six languages from the analysis of the Subtitle corpus (Chinese, Croatian, Hindi, Japanese, Filipino, and Zulu).  Our final sample included `r all_es_tidy %>% filter(!is.na(lang_es_wiki)|  !is.na(lang_es_sub)) %>% nrow()` languages in total (_N_~Wikipedia~ = `r filter(all_es_tidy, !is.na(lang_es_wiki)) %>% nrow()`; _N_~Subtitle~ = `r filter(all_es_tidy, !is.na(lang_es_sub)) %>% nrow()`), representing `r  length(unique(all_es_tidy$family))`  language families.  Finally, we calculated language-level measures for four additional measures by averaging across countries whose participants speak the same language: implicit and explicit psychological gender bias (estimated from the Project Implicit dataset), percentage of women in STEM fields, and median country age.

Despite the differences in the specific content conveyed by the Subtitles and Wikipedia corpus, the estimated gender bias for each language was similar across the two corpora (_t_(`r pluck(corpus_effect_t_test$parameter, "df")`) =  `r pluck(corpus_effect_t_test$statistic, "t")`, _p_ =  `r corpus_effect_t_test$p.value`). We next examined the relationship between these estimates of gender bias for each language and the mean IAT bias score for participants from countries where that language was dominant (and, we assume, was the native language of most of these individuals). Implicit gender bias was positively correlated with estimates of language bias from both the Subtitle (`r L_B_sub`) and Wikipedia trained models (`r L_B_wiki`; Fig. 2; Table 1 shows the language-level correlations between all variables in Studies 1b and 2). The relationship between implicit gender bias and language bias remained reliable after partialling out the effect of median country age  (Subtitle: `r L_B_sub_partial`; Wikipedia: `r L_B_wiki_partial`). Linguistic gender bias was not correlated with explicit gender bias (Subtitle: `r L_E_sub`; Wikipedia: `r L_E_wiki`). Estimates of language bias from the Subtitle corpus were correlated with the objective measure of gender equality, percentage of women in STEM fields (`r L_S_sub`); this relationship was not reliable for the Wikipedia corpus (`r L_S_wiki`).

### Discussion 
In Study 1, we found that a previously-reported psychological gender bias â€“ the bias to associate men with career and women with family â€“ was correlated with the magnitude of that same bias as measured in the language statistics of 25 languages. Participants completing the IAT in countries where the dominant language had stronger associations between men and career words, and women and family words, showed stronger biases on the gender-career IAT. This result is consistent with both the _language-as-reflection_ and _language-as-causal-factor_ hypotheses. In Study 2, we try to better distinguish between these hypotheses by investigating whether the gender-career bias is associated with two structural features of language: grammatical gender and the presence of gendered occupation terms (e.g., waiter/waitress).
