TO DO: 

- write GD
- get new confirmatory data - write up (1c)
- explore mediation analysis further
- get prop. gendered languages for intro
- check on japanese translations (and others?)
- spell check

* Look at native vs. dictionary tranlsated languages
* remove low frequency words - based on google hits?


Qs for Gary:
- langauge key on plots or full names?
- distinguish between study 1b and 2 measures in table?
- how was the subtitle model trained?
- 25 vs 26 languages
- flipping directions of scales: 

Note 1:
There's some complexity with how we flip or don't flip scales in experiment 1a vs. 2. In study 2, at the level of languages (fig 4), the M - F bias score is NEGATIVELY correlate with behavioral bias, and the F - M bias is POSITIVELY correlated with behavioral bias. I think this is the same phenomenon we were seeing (somewhere?) earlier that female bias of words was a better predictor of word meaning than male bias, the idea being that male bias just picks up on associations with general animacy. Okay - so if we want to keep all the correlations positive, I use the F-M measure here.

But, this is different from study 1a (fig 1) where I calculated the bias of a words as M - F distance. I did this because we oriented our likert scale for the human judgement task to be female -> male. 

So, there are two options, I think: 
(1) Use F - M distance in figure 1a, and flip the x-axis to be male -> female. This means it doesn't refelct how we actually asked the rating question, but maybe that's okay?
(2) Leave as is (I doubt readers will pick up on this subtly, and it's not really important interpretively for our point, at least).

Note 2:
There were a couple issues with the way values were being reported in the table, and so they have changed slightly: (1) relevant langauges for the iat languages measures were not getting excluded in the table values. The most notable difference is that wiki iat is now correlated with explicit values. (2) All the negative signs were getting cut off. The values in the text are correct.
