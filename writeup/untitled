Outline Notes
 * career-hand predicts career behavioral when you control for wps and mean age (not when you use ggi)
 * career-behavioral is correlated with WPS/GGI in the way that previous folks have found
 * career-hand/behavior is not correlated with flower-google hand.
 * career-hand and career-google are correlated at .61, but career-google doesn't predict anything
 * there's a relationship between behavior and language for career genius too?
