# Introduction

For general information about authoring in markdown, see **[here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).**

For standard spoken papers and standard posters, the entire 
contribution (including figures, references, everything) can be 
no longer than six pages. For abstract posters, the entire contribution 
can be no longer than one page. For symposia, the entire contribution 
can be no longer than two pages.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an
overall width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5
cm), with 0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces
between the last author listed and the text of the paper. The left
margin should be 0.75 inches and the top margin should be 1 inch.
\textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on whether you use
U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to measure the width of
the printed text.} Use 10 point Times Roman with 12 point vertical
spacing, unless otherwise specified.

The title should be in 14 point, bold, and centered. The title should
be formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
capitalized and the rest lower case). Each author's name should appear
on a separate line, 11 point bold, and centered, with the author's
email address in parentheses. Under each author's name list the
author's affiliation and postal address in ordinary 10 point  type.

Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8~inch (except for the
first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra vertical space
between paragraphs.

# First-Level Headings

First level headings should be in 12 point , initial caps, bold and
centered. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line space
below the heading.

## Second-Level Headings

Second level headings should be 11 point , initial caps, bold, and
flush left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~ line
space below the heading.

### Third-Level Headings

Third-level headings should be 10 point , initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
heading.

# Formalities, Footnotes, and Floats

Use standard APA citation format. Citations within the text should
include the author's last name and year. If the authors' names are
included in the sentence, place only the year in parentheses, as in
[-@NewellSimon1972a], but otherwise place the entire reference in
parentheses with the authors and year separated by a comma
[@NewellSimon1972a]. List multiple references alphabetically and
separate them by semicolons [@ChalnickBillman1988a; @NewellSimon1972a]. 
Use the et. al. construction only after listing all the authors to a
publication in an earlier reference and for citations with four or
more authors.

For more information on citations in R Markdown, see **[here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citations).**

## Footnotes

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9 point type at the
bottom of the page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a
horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

## Figures

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10 point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, or
set wide figures across both columns.

## Two-column images

You can read local images using png package for example and plot 
it like a regular plot using grid.raster from the grid package. 
With this method you have full control of the size of your image. **Note: Image must be in .png file format for the readPNG function to work.**

You might want to display a wide figure across both columns. To do this, you change the `fig.env` chunk option to `figure*`. To align the image in the center of the page, set `fig.align` option to `center`. To format the width of your caption text, you set the `num.cols.cap` option to `2`.

```{r 2-col-image, fig.env = "figure*", fig.pos = "h", fig.width=4, fig.height=2, fig.align = "center", set.cap.width=T, num.cols.cap=2, fig.cap = "This image spans both columns. And the caption text is limited to 0.8 of the width of the document."}
img <- png::readPNG("figs/walrus.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```

## One-column images

Single column is the default option, but if you want set it explicitly, set `fig.env` to `figure`. Notice that the `num.cols` option for the caption width is set to `1`.

```{r image, fig.env = "figure", fig.pos = "H", fig.align='center', fig.width=2, fig.height=2, set.cap.width=T, num.cols.cap=1, fig.cap = "One column image."}
img <- png::readPNG("figs/lab_logo_stanford.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```


## R Plots

You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs. And you can use latex floats in the
fig.pos chunk option to have more control over the location of your plot on the page. For more information on latex placement specifiers see **[here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions)**

```{r plot, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "H", fig.align = "center", fig.width=2, fig.height=2, fig.cap = "R plot" }
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
       aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Tables

Number tables consecutively; place the table number and title (in
10 point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
one line space below it, as in Table 1. You may float
tables to the top or bottom of a column, set wide tables across both
columns.

You can use the xtable function in the xtable package.

```{r xtable, results="asis"}
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
out <- lm(y ~ x)

tab1 <- xtable::xtable(summary(out)$coef, digits=c(0, 2, 2, 1, 2), 
                      caption = "This table prints across one column.")

print(tab1, type="latex", comment = F, table.placement = "H")
```

# Acknowledgements

the end of the paper.
