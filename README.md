Language use shapes cultural norms: Large scale evidence from gender
===

This project examines the relationship between gender bias and lexical semantics using data from IAT Project Implicit and word-embedding models. The directory `writup/cosgsci2018` contains all of the analysis code and most of the data for paper. Links are given for data too large to fit in this repository. The entire manuscript can be re-rendered from the markdown `writeup/cogsci2018/gender_cogsci_2018.Rmd`. A rendered version of the paper can be found at `writeup/cogsci2018/gender_cogsci_2018.pdf.` Feel free to email me with questions and comments at mollyllewis@gmail.com.

Below is a key figure from the paper showing cross-cultural variability in the magnitude of the bias to associate men with career and women with family, as measured by effect sizes from the IAT. All countries show a positive bias, with red and blue indicating above and below average bias.
